# Session 6 Handoff Document

## Completed in this Session

- Modified core modules for dynamic linking implementation:
  - Updated dependency resolution in `src/dependency.rs`
  - Enhanced dynamic linker functionality in `src/dynamic_linker.rs`
  - Improved extension management in `src/extension.rs`
  - Updated manifest handling in `src/manifest.rs`
  - Refactored main application logic in `src/main.rs`
- Removed obsolete `src/library.rs` module as part of the codebase cleanup

## Current State

The project is in Phase 4 (Dynamic Linking Implementation) at 50% completion. Core modules have been updated to improve the dynamic linking system, and obsolete code has been removed. The overall project completion stands at 58%.

## Technical Decisions Made

- Decision to remove the `library.rs` module: Simplified the codebase by removing obsolete functionality
- Updates to core modules: Enhanced the integration between dependency resolution, dynamic linking, and extension management

## Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge: Maintaining code consistency across multiple module updates
  Solution: Coordinated changes across dependency.rs, dynamic_linker.rs, extension.rs, and manifest.rs to ensure proper integration

## Next Steps

### Session 7: Continue Dynamic Linking Implementation

- Complete export resolution implementation
- Add support for calling functions across extension boundaries
- Implement comprehensive testing for the dynamic linking system
- Add error handling for edge cases in cross-extension communication

### Future Sessions

- Session 8: Begin Phase 5 (Integration and Extension Commands)
- Session 9: Start implementing comprehensive testing suite

## Additional Notes

The removal of library.rs and updates to core modules represent a significant step in streamlining the codebase and improving the dynamic linking implementation. The changes maintain alignment with our original project goals while reducing complexity.

## Next Session Instructions

To begin the next session effectively, please provide:

1. Any issues or unexpected behavior observed with the updated dynamic linking implementation
2. Specific test cases you'd like to prioritize for the cross-extension communication feature
