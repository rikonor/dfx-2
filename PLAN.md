# Extension Inter-Communication Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of an extension inter-communication feature for the dfx-2 project. The goal is to allow extensions to invoke functions from other extensions, specifically limited to "library" interfaces (those with the pattern `*/lib`).

The implementation will build upon the proof-of-concept work in the `tmp/` directory, which demonstrates automatic linking between WebAssembly components.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup and WIT Interface Updates (Session 1)

**Tasks:**

1. Update `world.wit` to support library interfaces for inter-extension communication
2. Create an initial version of `auto_linker.rs` module based on the proof-of-concept
3. Implement basic infrastructure for component analysis and dependency tracking
4. Add interface filtering to ensure only "\*/lib" interfaces are exposed for inter-extension calls

**Time Estimate:** 1 session
**Dependencies:** None
**Success Criteria:** Updated WIT interface and basic auto-linker structure in place

### Phase 2: Extension Discovery and Analysis (Session 2)

**Tasks:**

1. Enhance the manifest model to track dependencies between extensions
2. Implement functionality to analyze extensions for library exports and imports
3. Create utilities to extract interface patterns and validate library interfaces
4. Update the extension add/remove commands to track library dependencies

**Time Estimate:** 1 session
**Dependencies:** Phase 1
**Success Criteria:** System can properly identify and track library dependencies between extensions

### Phase 3: Dependency Resolution and Loading Order (Session 3)

**Tasks:**

1. Implement dependency graph construction for extensions
2. Create an algorithm to determine the correct extension loading order
3. Add cycle detection for circular dependencies
4. Update extension loading process to respect dependency order
5. Add validation during extension installation to check for dependency satisfaction

**Time Estimate:** 1 session
**Dependencies:** Phase 2
**Success Criteria:** Extensions are loaded in the correct order based on dependencies

### Phase 4: Dynamic Linking Implementation (Session 4)

**Tasks:**

1. Implement function reference registry to track inter-extension function references
2. Create dynamic linking functions for imports that reference exports
3. Implement automatic resolution of function references
4. Add support for calling functions across extension boundaries

**Time Estimate:** 1 session
**Dependencies:** Phase 3
**Success Criteria:** Extensions can successfully call library functions from other extensions

### Phase 5: Integration and Extension Commands (Session 5)

**Tasks:**

1. Update the main CLI workflow to use the auto-linker
2. Integrate auto-linking with the existing extension system
3. Update extension command execution path to support inter-extension calls
4. Add new commands for listing available libraries and dependencies

**Time Estimate:** 1 session
**Dependencies:** Phase 4
**Success Criteria:** Full integration with existing CLI and extension system

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement (Session 6)

**Tasks:**

1. Create test extensions to verify correct functionality
2. Add comprehensive error handling for dependency and linking issues
3. Optimize performance of extension loading and linking
4. Add support for version checking of library interfaces
5. Update documentation with information about the library feature

**Time Estimate:** 1 session
**Dependencies:** Phase 5
**Success Criteria:** System works correctly with test extensions and handles error cases gracefully

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Ensuring Only Library Interfaces Are Exposed

**Solution:** Implement pattern matching for interface names to ensure only those ending with \*/lib can be imported or exported between extensions. Add validation at both load time and runtime.

### Challenge 2: Circular Dependencies

**Solution:** Implement cycle detection in the dependency resolution algorithm. Provide clear error messages when circular dependencies are found, suggesting how to resolve them.

### Challenge 3: Performance Impact

**Solution:** Optimize component analysis and linking to minimize startup time impact. Consider lazy loading of extensions that aren't immediately needed.

### Challenge 4: Backward Compatibility

**Solution:** Ensure existing extensions continue to work without modification. The system should transparently handle extensions with or without library interfaces.

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality:** Extensions can successfully invoke library functions from other extensions
2. **Performance:** The system maintains reasonable startup and execution times
3. **Usability:** Developers can easily create and use library interfaces
4. **Robustness:** The system handles error cases gracefully and provides helpful diagnostics

## Future Enhancements (Post-Implementation)

1. Extension marketplace or registry for discovering and sharing library extensions
2. Version compatibility checking for library interfaces
3. Support for asynchronous library calls
4. Sandboxing improvements for security between extensions
