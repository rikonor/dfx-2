**Overall Project Completion:** 50%

## Recently Completed Tasks

- Created `DependencyGraph` struct to represent dependencies between extensions
- Implemented cycle detection using depth-first search
- Implemented topological sorting for determining the correct loading order
- Added dependency validation to check for missing interfaces and functions
- Updated `main.rs` to use the dependency graph for loading extensions
- Added a new `deps` subcommand to display extension dependencies
- Updated `ExtensionAdder` to validate dependencies during installation

## Current Focus

Implementing Phase 4: Dynamic Linking Implementation

## Blockers / Challenges

_No blockers identified yet_

## Next Steps

1. Create a function reference registry to track inter-extension function references
2. Implement dynamic linking functions for imports that reference exports
3. Implement automatic resolution of function references
4. Add support for calling functions across extension boundaries

## Notes and Observations

- The existing proof-of-concept provides a solid foundation for implementing the extension inter-communication feature
- Library interfaces (\*/lib) will need special handling in both the WIT specification and the implementation
- Initial code review suggests the current architecture can support the new feature with minimal disruption to existing functionality
- Tracking imports/exports in the manifest file will enable:
  - Dependency resolution for correct extension loading order
  - Validation at installation time to prevent runtime errors
  - Performance optimization by avoiding repeated component analysis
  - Better extension management with dependency checking
  - Improved discoverability of available library interfaces
