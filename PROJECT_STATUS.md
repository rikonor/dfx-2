**Overall Project Completion:** 10%

## Recently Completed Tasks

- Updated `Extension` struct in `manifest.rs` to track library interfaces
- Added `ExportedInterface` and `ImportedInterface` structs
- Added conversion methods between library.rs types and manifest.rs types
- Modified `DetectLibraryInterfaces` trait to be object-safe
- Updated `ExtensionAdder` to detect and store library interfaces when adding an extension
- Updated `main.rs` to create and pass the detector to the `ExtensionAdder`

## Current Focus

Implementing Phase 1: Foundation Setup and WIT Interface Updates

## Blockers / Challenges

_No blockers identified yet_

## Next Steps

1. Implement dependency resolution functionality
   - Create a dependency graph for extensions
   - Implement an algorithm to determine the correct extension loading order
   - Add cycle detection for circular dependencies
2. Create function reference registry
3. Update extension loading process to respect dependency order

## Notes and Observations

- The existing proof-of-concept provides a solid foundation for implementing the extension inter-communication feature
- Library interfaces (\*/lib) will need special handling in both the WIT specification and the implementation
- Initial code review suggests the current architecture can support the new feature with minimal disruption to existing functionality
- Tracking imports/exports in the manifest file will enable:
  - Dependency resolution for correct extension loading order
  - Validation at installation time to prevent runtime errors
  - Performance optimization by avoiding repeated component analysis
  - Better extension management with dependency checking
  - Improved discoverability of available library interfaces
