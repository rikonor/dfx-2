## Recently Completed Tasks

- Created detailed implementation plan for Phase 1
- Updated GUIDELINES.md with code modification best practices
- Broke down Phase 1 into multiple sessions for incremental implementation

## Current Focus

Implementing Phase 1: Foundation Setup and WIT Interface Updates

## Blockers / Challenges

_No blockers identified yet_

## Next Steps

1. Create `src/library.rs` module for library interface detection
2. Update `Extension` struct in `manifest.rs` to track library interfaces
3. Implement dependency resolution functionality
4. Create function reference registry

## Notes and Observations

- The existing proof-of-concept provides a solid foundation for implementing the extension inter-communication feature
- Library interfaces (\*/lib) will need special handling in both the WIT specification and the implementation
- Initial code review suggests the current architecture can support the new feature with minimal disruption to existing functionality
