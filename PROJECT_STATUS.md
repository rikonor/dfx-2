**Overall Project Completion:** 58%

## Recently Completed Tasks

- Created `FunctionRegistry` struct to track function references between extensions
- Implemented `DynamicLinker` for linking imports and managing function references
- Added support for registering function references and creating proxy functions
- Updated `main.rs` to use the dynamic linker for linking imports
- Set up the infrastructure for cross-extension function calls
- Implemented error handling for unresolved references

## Current Focus

Implementing Phase 4: Dynamic Linking Implementation

## Blockers / Challenges

- **Accessing the underlying wasmtime instance**: We need to find a way to access the underlying wasmtime instance from the Extension type generated by the bindgen! macro to implement export resolution. That said, I was under the impression that I could access instances through the linker:

```
lnk.instance(...)
lnk.instantiate(...)
etc
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement export resolution by finding a way to access the underlying wasmtime instance
2. Complete the dynamic linking implementation to resolve function references
3. Add support for calling functions across extension boundaries
4. Add comprehensive error handling for missing or unresolved functions
5. Add tests for the dynamic linking implementation

## Notes and Observations

- The existing proof-of-concept provides a solid foundation for implementing the extension inter-communication feature
- Library interfaces (\*/lib) will need special handling in both the WIT specification and the implementation
- Initial code review suggests the current architecture can support the new feature with minimal disruption to existing functionality
- Tracking imports/exports in the manifest file will enable:
  - Dependency resolution for correct extension loading order
  - Validation at installation time to prevent runtime errors
  - Performance optimization by avoiding repeated component analysis
  - Better extension management with dependency checking
  - Improved discoverability of available library interfaces
