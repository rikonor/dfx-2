**Overall Project Completion:** 5%

## Recently Completed Tasks

- Created `src/library.rs` module with core data structures for library interface detection
- Implemented `LibraryFunction` and `LibraryInterface` structs
- Implemented `DetectLibraryInterfaces` trait and its implementation
- Added tests for library interface detection
- Updated `src/main.rs` to include the new library module

## Current Focus

Implementing Phase 1: Foundation Setup and WIT Interface Updates

## Blockers / Challenges

_No blockers identified yet_

## Next Steps

1. Update `Extension` struct in `manifest.rs` to track library interfaces
   - Add fields for exported and imported library interfaces
   - Update serialization/deserialization to include the new fields
   - Add tests for the updated manifest model
2. Implement dependency resolution functionality
3. Create function reference registry

## Notes and Observations

- The existing proof-of-concept provides a solid foundation for implementing the extension inter-communication feature
- Library interfaces (\*/lib) will need special handling in both the WIT specification and the implementation
- Initial code review suggests the current architecture can support the new feature with minimal disruption to existing functionality
- Tracking imports/exports in the manifest file will enable:
  - Dependency resolution for correct extension loading order
  - Validation at installation time to prevent runtime errors
  - Performance optimization by avoiding repeated component analysis
  - Better extension management with dependency checking
  - Improved discoverability of available library interfaces
