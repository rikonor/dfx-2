## Recently Completed Tasks

_No tasks completed yet_

## Current Focus

Preparing to begin Phase 1: Foundation Setup and WIT Interface Updates

## Blockers / Challenges

_No blockers identified yet_

## Next Steps

1. Update `world.wit` to include library interface support
2. Create initial `auto_linker.rs` module based on the proof-of-concept
3. Implement basic component analysis infrastructure

## Notes and Observations

- The existing proof-of-concept provides a solid foundation for implementing the extension inter-communication feature
- Library interfaces (\*/lib) will need special handling in both the WIT specification and the implementation
- Initial code review suggests the current architecture can support the new feature with minimal disruption to existing functionality
