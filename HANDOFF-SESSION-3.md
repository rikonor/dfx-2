# Session 3 Handoff Document

## Completed in this Session

- Updated `Extension` struct in `manifest.rs` to track library interfaces:
  - Added `exported_interfaces` field to track interfaces that the extension provides
  - Added `imported_interfaces` field to track interfaces that the extension depends on
- Created new data structures:
  - `ExportedInterface` struct to represent interfaces exported by an extension
  - `ImportedInterface` struct to represent interfaces imported by an extension
- Added conversion methods between `LibraryInterface` from `library.rs` and `ExportedInterface` in `manifest.rs`
- Modified the `DetectLibraryInterfaces` trait to be object-safe by removing the generic parameter
- Updated the `ExtensionAdder` to:
  - Accept a library interface detector as a dependency (following dependency injection principles)
  - Detect library interfaces when adding an extension
  - Store the detected interfaces in the extension's manifest entry
- Updated `main.rs` to create and pass the detector to the `ExtensionAdder`

## Current State

We've completed the implementation of library interface tracking in the manifest model, which is a key part of Phase 1 (Foundation Setup and WIT Interface Updates). The system can now detect library interfaces when adding extensions and store this information in the manifest.

The current implementation provides the foundation for dependency resolution, which will be implemented in the next session. With the manifest model updated to track library interfaces, we can now build the dependency graph and determine the correct extension loading order.

## Technical Decisions Made

- Decision to use dependency injection for the `LibraryInterfaceDetector`: We decided to pass the detector as a dependency to the `ExtensionAdder` rather than creating it internally. This follows good design principles and will make testing easier in the future.
- Decision to make the `DetectLibraryInterfaces` trait object-safe: We removed the generic parameter from the `detect` method to make the trait object-safe, which allows us to use it with `Arc<dyn DetectLibraryInterfaces>`. This provides more flexibility in how we use the trait.
- Decision to reuse the precompiled component for library interface detection: Instead of recompiling the component, we deserialize the precompiled component for library interface detection. This is more efficient and avoids unnecessary work.
- Decision to use `#[serde(default)]` for the new fields in the `Extension` struct: This ensures backward compatibility with existing manifests, which won't have these fields.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge: Making the `DetectLibraryInterfaces` trait object-safe
  Solution: Removed the generic parameter from the `detect` method, which was not needed since we're not using the store parameter in the current implementation.

- Challenge: Efficiently detecting library interfaces
  Solution: Reused the precompiled component instead of recompiling it, which is more efficient.

## Next Steps

### Session 4: Implement Dependency Resolution

- Create a dependency graph for extensions based on their imported and exported interfaces
- Implement an algorithm to determine the correct extension loading order
- Add cycle detection for circular dependencies
- Update the extension loading process to respect the dependency order

### Future Sessions

- Session 5: Create function reference registry
- Session 6: Update extension management to handle library interfaces
- Session 7: Implement dynamic linking between extensions

## Additional Notes

The changes made in this session provide a solid foundation for the dependency resolution functionality that will be implemented in the next session. The manifest model now contains all the information needed to build the dependency graph and determine the correct extension loading order.

We've also improved the code quality by following good design principles like dependency injection, which will make the code more maintainable and testable in the future.

## Next Session Instructions

To begin the next session effectively, please provide:

1. The current state of the project repository (it should include all the changes committed in this session)
2. Any specific requirements or constraints for the dependency resolution implementation that weren't covered in our planning discussions
