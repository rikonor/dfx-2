# Final Project Handoff Document

## Project Overview

This document details the progress of the extension inter-communication feature for dfx-2, including the recent workspace restructuring and plans for component testing.

## Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup and WIT Interface Updates

- Created initial implementation plan and guidelines
- Set up project structure with core modules
- Status: âœ“ Completed (100%)

### Phase 2: Extension Discovery and Analysis

- Implemented library interface detection
- Created manifest model for tracking interfaces
- Status: âœ“ Completed (100%)

### Phase 3: Dependency Resolution and Loading Order

- Created dependency graph implementation
- Implemented cycle detection and validation
- Status: âœ“ Completed (100%)

### Phase 4: Dynamic Linking Implementation

- Created function reference registry
- Implemented dynamic linking with async support
- Successfully tested cross-extension function calls
- Status: âš¡ In Progress (75%)

Recent Achievements:

- Successfully implemented async function calls
- Added Send trait bound to generic type T in link_imports
- Demonstrated working cross-extension function calls (ext-add calling ext-js)
- Restructured project as a Rust workspace for better organization

### Phase 5: Integration and Extension Commands

- Status: ðŸ”„ Not Started (0%)

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement

- Status: ðŸ”„ Not Started (0%)

## Current Project Structure

```
dfx-2/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml          # Workspace manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/              # Project documentation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ crates/           # All crates live here
    â”œâ”€â”€ dfx-cli/      # Main CLI tool
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/

```

## Recent Changes

### Workspace Restructuring

1. Converted project to a Rust workspace
2. Created dedicated `crates/` directory for better organization
3. Successfully migrated dfx-cli to the new structure
4. Added hello-world example crate to validate workspace setup
5. Maintained proper separation of workspace and crate-specific files
6. Verified all functionality works in new structure

### Technical Decisions

1. **Workspace Organization**

   - Created `crates/` directory to house all crates
   - Kept docs at root level for better visibility
   - Structured for scalability as we add more extensions

2. **Crate Organization**
   - Moved CLI implementation to dfx-cli crate
   - Created simple hello-world crate for testing
   - Set up workspace with resolver = "2"

## Next Steps

### Immediate Focus: WAT-Based Component Mocking

1. Create WAT templates for mock components
2. Set up testing infrastructure in new workspace structure
3. Write initial test cases using mock components
4. Document component mocking patterns

### Upcoming Tasks

1. Complete async implementation documentation
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Begin planning for Phase 5 integration

## Technical Notes for Next Session

To begin implementing WAT-based component mocking, we'll need to:

1. Create a test utilities crate in the workspace
2. Set up WAT template generation
3. Implement mock component creation
4. Write test cases that validate async functionality
