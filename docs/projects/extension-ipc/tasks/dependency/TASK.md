# Dependency Management Task

## Overview

Implement a system for tracking and managing dependencies between extensions, ensuring they are loaded in the correct order and detecting circular dependencies.

## Scope

- Dependency tracking between extensions
- Loading order resolution
- Circular dependency detection
- Library interface validation

## Status

- Current Phase: Complete
- Progress: 100%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-17

## Implementation Details

### Dependency Resolution and Loading Order

- Implemented dependency graph construction for extensions
- Created an algorithm to determine the correct extension loading order
- Added cycle detection for circular dependencies
- Updated extension loading process to respect dependency order
- Added validation during extension installation to check for dependency satisfaction

### Technical Implementation

The dependency management system works by:

1. Analyzing each extension's imports and exports to identify dependencies
2. Constructing a directed graph representing the dependency relationships
3. Performing a topological sort to determine the correct loading order
4. Detecting cycles in the graph to identify circular dependencies
5. Validating that all required dependencies are satisfied before loading

## Dependencies

- Cross-Extension Communication Task: Required for identifying library interfaces

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Circular Dependencies

Implemented cycle detection in the dependency resolution algorithm. Provided clear error messages when circular dependencies are found, suggesting how to resolve them.

### Backward Compatibility

Ensured existing extensions continue to work without modification. The system transparently handles extensions with or without library interfaces.

## Success Criteria

- Extensions are loaded in the correct order based on dependencies
- Circular dependencies are detected and reported with helpful error messages
- The system validates that all required dependencies are satisfied
- Existing extensions continue to work without modification

## Demonstrated Capabilities

- Dependency tracking between extensions working correctly
- Loading order resolution handling multiple extensions
- Circular dependency detection providing helpful error messages

## Notes

This task was part of the original Extension Inter-Communication project, which has been completed. The functionality will be migrated to the new dfx-core crate as part of the Core Extraction project.
