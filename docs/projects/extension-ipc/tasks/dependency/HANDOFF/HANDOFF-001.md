# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

The Dependency Management task is complete. All planned functionality has been implemented and tested.

## Completed Work

- Dependency tracking between extensions implemented
- Loading order resolution working correctly
- Circular dependency detection implemented
- Library interface validation added

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

The dependency management functionality was implemented through a systematic approach:

1. **Dependency Graph Construction**: Created a directed graph representing dependencies between extensions
2. **Topological Sorting**: Implemented an algorithm to determine the correct loading order
3. **Cycle Detection**: Added functionality to detect and report circular dependencies
4. **Validation**: Implemented checks to ensure all required dependencies are satisfied

### Key Technical Decisions

- Used a graph-based approach for modeling dependencies
- Implemented topological sorting for determining loading order
- Added cycle detection to identify circular dependencies
- Provided clear error messages when issues are detected

## Challenges

- **Circular Dependencies**: Detecting and providing helpful error messages for circular dependencies
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensuring existing extensions continue to work without modification

## Reference to Original Documentation

This task was part of the original Extension Inter-Communication project. For historical context, refer to:

- Original project plan: `docs/projects/extension-ipc/PLAN.md` (Phase 3)
- Completion status: `docs/projects/extension-ipc/COMPLETION.md` (Feature 2)
- Project status tracking: `docs/projects/extension-ipc/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- Session handoffs: `docs/projects/extension-ipc/HANDOFF/HANDOFF-SESSION-*.md`

## Notes

The functionality implemented in this task will be migrated to the new icp-core crate as part of the Core Extraction project, which will improve testability and make the functionality available as a reusable library.
