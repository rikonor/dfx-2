# Core Infrastructure Task

## Overview

Implement the core infrastructure needed to support cross-extension communication, including async support, thread-safe function reference handling, and integration with the main CLI workflow.

## Scope

- Async support for cross-extension calls
- Thread-safe function reference handling
- Integration with main CLI workflow
- Testing and refinement

## Status

- Current Phase: Complete
- Progress: 100%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-17

## Implementation Details

### Integration and Extension Commands

- Updated the main CLI workflow to use the auto-linker
- Integrated auto-linking with the existing extension system
- Updated extension command execution path to support inter-extension calls
- Added new commands for listing available libraries and dependencies

### Testing and Refinement

- Created test extensions to verify correct functionality
- Added comprehensive error handling for dependency and linking issues
- Optimized performance of extension loading and linking
- Added support for version checking of library interfaces
- Updated documentation with information about the library feature

### Async Support

- Implemented async function calls between extensions
- Added Send trait bound to generic type T in link_imports for thread safety
- Demonstrated working cross-extension function calls (ext-add calling ext-js)

## Dependencies

- Cross-Extension Communication Task: Required for function reference registry
- Dependency Management Task: Required for loading extensions in the correct order

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Thread Safety

Added Send trait bound to generic type T in link_imports to ensure thread safety when making cross-extension calls.

### Performance Optimization

Optimized component analysis and linking to minimize startup time impact. Considered lazy loading of extensions that aren't immediately needed.

## Success Criteria

- Full integration with existing CLI and extension system
- System works correctly with test extensions and handles error cases gracefully
- Async function calls between extensions work correctly
- Thread-safe function reference handling is implemented

## Demonstrated Capabilities

- Successful async implementation and cross-extension function calls
- Thread-safe function reference handling
- Integration with main CLI workflow

## Known Areas for Future Enhancement

1. Performance optimization opportunities in async operations
2. Additional error handling cases to consider
3. Potential for extended library interface features
4. Documentation improvements for extension developers

## Notes

This task was part of the original Extension Inter-Communication project, which has been completed. The functionality will be migrated to the new icp-core crate as part of the Core Extraction project.
