# Cross-Extension Communication Task

## Overview

Implement functionality to allow extensions to invoke functions from other extensions, specifically limited to "library" interfaces (those with the pattern `*/lib`).

## Scope

- Function reference registry implementation
- Dynamic linking between extensions
- Async function calls support
- Library interface pattern (`*/lib`) enforcement

## Status

- Current Phase: Complete
- Progress: 100%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-17

## Implementation Details

### Foundation Setup and WIT Interface Updates

- Updated `world.wit` to support library interfaces for inter-extension communication
- Created initial version of auto-linker module based on proof-of-concept
- Implemented basic infrastructure for component analysis and dependency tracking
- Added interface filtering to ensure only "\*/lib" interfaces are exposed for inter-extension calls

### Extension Discovery and Analysis

- Enhanced the manifest model to track dependencies between extensions
- Implemented functionality to analyze extensions for library exports and imports
- Created utilities to extract interface patterns and validate library interfaces
- Updated the extension add/remove commands to track library dependencies

### Dynamic Linking Implementation

- Implemented function reference registry to track inter-extension function references
- Created dynamic linking functions for imports that reference exports
- Implemented automatic resolution of function references
- Added support for calling functions across extension boundaries

## Dependencies

- Dependency Management Task: Required for loading order resolution
- Core Infrastructure Task: Required for integration with main CLI workflow

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Ensuring Only Library Interfaces Are Exposed

Implemented pattern matching for interface names to ensure only those ending with \*/lib can be imported or exported between extensions. Added validation at both load time and runtime.

### Performance Impact

Optimized component analysis and linking to minimize startup time impact.

## Success Criteria

- Extensions can successfully invoke library functions from other extensions
- The system maintains reasonable startup and execution times
- Developers can easily create and use library interfaces
- The system handles error cases gracefully and provides helpful diagnostics

## Demonstrated Capabilities

- Successful cross-extension function calls (e.g., ext-add calling ext-js)
- Library interface pattern working as intended

## Notes

This task was part of the original Extension Inter-Communication project, which has been completed. The functionality will be migrated to the new icp-core crate as part of the Core Extraction project.
