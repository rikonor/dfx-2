# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

The Cross-Extension Communication task is complete. All planned functionality has been implemented and tested.

## Completed Work

- Function reference registry implemented
- Dynamic linking between extensions working
- Async function calls supported
- Library interface pattern (`*/lib`) enforced

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

The cross-extension communication functionality was implemented through a multi-phase approach:

1. **Foundation Setup**: Updated WIT interfaces and created the initial auto-linker module
2. **Extension Discovery**: Enhanced the manifest model to track dependencies and analyze extensions
3. **Dynamic Linking**: Implemented the function reference registry and automatic resolution

### Key Technical Decisions

- Used a registry-based approach for tracking function references between extensions
- Implemented pattern matching to enforce the `*/lib` interface convention
- Added validation at both load time and runtime to ensure only library interfaces are exposed

## Challenges

- **Interface Filtering**: Ensuring only library interfaces are exposed required careful pattern matching and validation
- **Performance Considerations**: Needed to optimize component analysis and linking to minimize startup time impact

## Reference to Original Documentation

This task was part of the original Extension Inter-Communication project. For historical context, refer to:

- Original project plan: `docs/projects/extension-ipc/PLAN.md` (Phases 1, 2, 4)
- Completion status: `docs/projects/extension-ipc/COMPLETION.md` (Feature 1)
- Project status tracking: `docs/projects/extension-ipc/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- Session handoffs: `docs/projects/extension-ipc/HANDOFF/HANDOFF-SESSION-*.md`

## Notes

The functionality implemented in this task will be migrated to the new icp-core crate as part of the Core Extraction project, which will improve testability and make the functionality available as a reusable library.
