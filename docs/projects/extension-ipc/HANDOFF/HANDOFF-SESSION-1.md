# Session 1 Handoff Document

## Completed in this Session

- Created a detailed implementation plan for the extension inter-communication feature
- Updated GUIDELINES.md with code modification best practices
- Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md to reflect current progress
- Broke down Phase 1 into multiple sessions for incremental implementation

## Current State

We've completed the planning phase for implementing the extension inter-communication feature. The project is now in Phase 1 (Foundation Setup and WIT Interface Updates) with an estimated completion of 10%. We've decided to break down Phase 1 into multiple sessions to ensure manageable and testable increments.

## Technical Decisions Made

- Decision to not modify the host's WIT file: Each extension will have its own WIT file that defines its imports and exports, and the system will detect these on-the-fly.
- Decision to use async traits with focused methods: Instead of using a "god object" pattern like in the proof-of-concept, we'll follow the existing codebase's pattern of using async traits with focused methods.
- Decision to break down functionality into smaller components: We'll create separate modules for library interface detection, dependency resolution, and function reference management.
- Decision to enforce the `*/lib` pattern for library interfaces: Only interfaces matching this pattern will be exposed for inter-extension calls.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge: Avoiding a "god object" design like the AutoLinker in the proof-of-concept
  Solution: Break down functionality into smaller, more focused components with clear responsibilities

- Challenge: Ensuring backward compatibility with existing extensions
  Solution: Design the system to gracefully handle extensions with or without library interfaces

## Next Steps

### Session 2: Library Interface Detection

- Create `src/library.rs` module
- Implement `LibraryInterface` and `LibraryFunction` structs
- Implement `DetectLibraryInterfaces` trait and its implementation
- Add tests for library interface detection

### Future Sessions

- Session 3: Update manifest model to track library interfaces
- Session 4: Implement dependency resolution
- Session 5: Create function reference registry
- Session 6: Update extension management to handle library interfaces

## Additional Notes

The existing codebase has a well-structured extension system that we can build upon. The proof-of-concept in the tmp/ directory provides valuable insights into how to implement automatic linking and dependency resolution, but we'll need to adapt it to fit the existing architecture and follow better design patterns.

Key files to focus on in the next session:

- src/manifest.rs: Will need updating to track library interfaces
- src/extension.rs: Handles extension management
- src/main.rs: Contains the main application logic that loads and runs extensions

The next session should focus on creating the library interface detection functionality, which is the foundation for the rest of the implementation.

## Next Session Instructions

To begin the next session effectively, please provide:

1. The current state of the project repository (it should include all the changes committed in this session)
2. Access to the test extensions with library interfaces that you mentioned, including their WIT definitions and WASM files
3. Any specific requirements or constraints for the library interface detection implementation that weren't covered in our planning discussions
