# Session 4 Handoff Document

## Completed in this Session

- Created `src/dependency.rs` module with core data structures and algorithms:
  - `DependencyGraph` struct to represent dependencies between extensions
  - `DependencyError` enum for dependency-related errors
  - Implemented cycle detection using depth-first search
  - Implemented topological sorting for determining the correct loading order
  - Added dependency validation to check for missing interfaces and functions
  - Added text-based visualization of the dependency graph
- Updated `src/main.rs` to use the dependency graph for loading extensions:
  - Modified extension loading process to respect dependency order
  - Added warning messages for circular dependencies and validation failures
  - Added a new `deps` subcommand to display extension dependencies
- Updated `src/extension.rs` to validate dependencies during installation:
  - Added dependency validation to the `ExtensionAdder`
  - Added a new error type for dependency validation failures
  - Implemented cleanup of temporary files when validation fails

## Current State

We've completed the implementation of dependency resolution and loading order, which is a key part of Phase 3. The system can now:

1. Build a dependency graph from the manifest
2. Detect circular dependencies
3. Determine the correct loading order for extensions
4. Validate that all dependencies are satisfied
5. Load extensions in the correct order
6. Validate dependencies during extension installation

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the dynamic linking implementation that will be implemented in the next session.

## Technical Decisions Made

- **Decision to use adjacency list for graph representation**: We used a simple adjacency list representation for the dependency graph, which is efficient for sparse graphs and makes traversal operations straightforward.
- **Decision to use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting**: This algorithm naturally handles cycle detection and provides a clear ordering of extensions based on their dependencies.
- **Decision to validate dependencies during installation**: By validating dependencies at installation time, we can catch issues early and provide clear error messages to users.
- **Decision to use text-based visualization**: We implemented a simple text-based visualization of the dependency graph, which is easy to understand and doesn't require external tools.
- **Decision to clean up temporary files on validation failure**: When dependency validation fails during installation, we clean up any temporary files to avoid leaving the system in an inconsistent state.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge: Handling circular dependencies**
  Solution: Implemented cycle detection using depth-first search and provided clear error messages with the specific cycle detected.

- **Challenge: Determining the correct loading order**
  Solution: Used topological sorting to determine a valid loading order that respects dependencies.

- **Challenge: Validating dependencies during installation**
  Solution: Created a temporary dependency graph with the new extension to check for potential issues before committing the changes.

- **Challenge: Providing useful feedback to users**
  Solution: Implemented text-based visualization of the dependency graph and detailed error messages for dependency issues.

## Next Steps

### Session 5: Implement Dynamic Linking

- Create a function reference registry to track inter-extension function references
- Implement dynamic linking functions for imports that reference exports
- Implement automatic resolution of function references
- Add support for calling functions across extension boundaries

### Future Sessions

- Session 6: Update extension management to handle library interfaces
- Session 7: Implement comprehensive testing and refinement

## Additional Notes

The dependency resolution implementation provides a solid foundation for the dynamic linking implementation. The system can now load extensions in the correct order, which is a prerequisite for dynamic linking.

The text-based visualization of the dependency graph is a useful tool for debugging and understanding the relationships between extensions. It could be extended in the future to support more advanced visualization formats like DOT for Graphviz.

### Notes from PoC Review

I reviewed the proof-of-concept (PoC) in the `tmp/` directory and found several valuable insights that will be helpful for the next phase of implementation:

1. **Function Reference Registry**: The PoC implements a function reference registry using `HashMap<String, Arc<Mutex<Option<Func>>>>` that enables dynamic linking between components. This approach allows functions to be resolved after components are instantiated, which is a key innovation we should incorporate in our dynamic linking implementation.

2. **Dynamic Linking Mechanism**: The PoC demonstrates a dynamic linking approach where function references are initially created as `None` (unresolved), components are linked using these references, and after instantiation, references are resolved to actual functions. This allows for flexible, automatic linking without hardcoded connections.

3. **Interface and Function Discovery**: The PoC includes a function to discover functions in interfaces, which is similar to our library interface detection in library.rs. We might want to enhance our implementation based on this approach.

4. **Clean API for Extensions**: The PoC provides a simple, clean API for working with components, which we should emulate in our implementation to make it easy for extensions to interact with each other. (NOTE FROM HUMAN: This bit here is a little ambiguous. Perhaps you could mention to me your thoughts here, because it's not clear what a clean API means in this context).

For the next phase (Dynamic Linking Implementation), we should focus on:

1. Creating a function reference registry similar to the PoC's implementation
2. Implementing dynamic linking functions for imports that reference exports
3. Adding support for calling functions across extension boundaries
4. Providing a clean API for extensions to interact with each other
