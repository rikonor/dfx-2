# Extension Inter-Communication Project

## Purpose

Enable extensions to invoke functions from other extensions, specifically limited to "library" interfaces (those with the pattern `*/lib`), allowing for modular and composable extension development.

## Status

Complete âœ…

## Tasks

- [Complete] Cross-Extension Communication Task

  - Implement function reference registry and dynamic linking between extensions
  - Located in: `tasks/communication/`

- [Complete] Dependency Management Task

  - Implement dependency tracking, loading order resolution, and circular dependency detection
  - Located in: `tasks/dependency/`

- [Complete] Core Infrastructure Task

  - Implement async support, thread-safe handling, and CLI workflow integration
  - Located in: `tasks/infrastructure/`

## Project Completion

The Extension Inter-Communication project has been successfully completed, with all planned functionality implemented and tested. The key features include:

1. Cross-extension function calls working correctly
2. Dependency tracking and loading order resolution
3. Async support and thread-safe function reference handling
4. Integration with the main CLI workflow

## Next Steps

The functionality implemented in this project will be migrated to the new icp-core crate as part of the Core Extraction project, which will:

1. Improve testability of the implementation
2. Make the functionality available as a reusable library
3. Add comprehensive testing coverage
4. Provide better documentation and examples

## Known Areas for Future Enhancement

1. Performance optimization opportunities in async operations
2. Additional error handling cases to consider
3. Potential for extended library interface features
4. Documentation improvements for extension developers
