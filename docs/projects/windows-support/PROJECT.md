## Project Overview

The Windows Support project aims to extend icp-cli's platform support to include Windows, ensuring that developers on Windows can use the tool with the same level of functionality and reliability as on other platforms. This involves not just adding Windows builds, but also implementing proper Windows-specific functionality, comprehensive testing, and detailed documentation.

## Current Focus

With the Windows Build Infrastructure task complete, focus is shifting to Windows-specific compatibility work.

## Next Steps

1. Plan Windows Compatibility task:

   - Identify Windows-specific code paths needed
   - Plan path handling implementation
   - Design Windows permission handling

2. Prepare for Testing Framework task:
   - Research Windows CI environment requirements
   - Plan test case scenarios
   - Design automated verification approach

## Dependencies

This project builds upon the Core Extraction project, particularly the CLI Simplification task, ensuring that Windows support is implemented in alignment with the new architecture.

## Known Issues

1. Binary Signing: Windows executables may require code signing for enhanced security and user trust. This will be evaluated as part of the build infrastructure completion.
