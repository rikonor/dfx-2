## Project Overview

The Windows Support project aims to extend dfx-cli's platform support to include Windows, ensuring that developers on Windows can use the tool with the same level of functionality and reliability as on other platforms. This involves not just adding Windows builds, but also implementing proper Windows-specific functionality, comprehensive testing, and detailed documentation.

## Current Focus

The Windows Build Infrastructure task is nearly complete, with core CI pipeline support for Windows builds implemented. Current focus is on finalizing the build infrastructure task while preparing for the transition to Windows-specific compatibility work.

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Build Infrastructure items:

   - Evaluate binary signing requirements
   - Plan basic smoke test implementation
   - Document Windows build process

2. Plan Windows Compatibility task:

   - Identify Windows-specific code paths needed
   - Plan path handling implementation
   - Design Windows permission handling

3. Prepare for Testing Framework task:
   - Research Windows CI environment requirements
   - Plan test case scenarios
   - Design automated verification approach

## Dependencies

This project builds upon the Core Extraction project, particularly the CLI Simplification task, ensuring that Windows support is implemented in alignment with the new architecture.

## Known Issues

1. Binary Signing: Windows executables may require code signing for enhanced security and user trust. This will be evaluated as part of the build infrastructure completion.

## Timeline

Each task is expected to take 1-2 working sessions, with the entire project estimated to complete in 4-8 sessions.
