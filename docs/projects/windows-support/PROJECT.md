## Project Overview

The Windows Support project aims to extend dfx-cli's platform support to include Windows, ensuring that developers on Windows can use the tool with the same level of functionality and reliability as on other platforms. This involves not just adding Windows builds, but also implementing proper Windows-specific functionality, comprehensive testing, and detailed documentation.

## Current Focus

The initial focus will be on the Windows Build Infrastructure task to establish the foundation for Windows support. This includes setting up the build pipeline and ensuring basic functionality works on Windows.

## Next Steps

1. Begin Windows Build Infrastructure task:

   - Add Windows target (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc) to CI matrix
   - Configure Windows-specific build settings
   - Set up artifact handling for Windows executables

2. Plan Windows Compatibility task:

   - Identify Windows-specific code paths needed
   - Plan path handling implementation
   - Design Windows permission handling

3. Prepare for Testing Framework task:
   - Research Windows CI environment requirements
   - Plan test case scenarios
   - Design automated verification approach

## Dependencies

This project builds upon the Core Extraction project, particularly the CLI Simplification task, ensuring that Windows support is implemented in alignment with the new architecture.

## Known Issues

None identified yet - issues will be documented as they are discovered during implementation.

## Timeline

Each task is expected to take 1-2 working sessions, with the entire project estimated to complete in 4-8 sessions.
