# Windows Compatibility Task

## Overview

Implement Windows-specific functionality and optimizations in dfx-cli to ensure proper operation on Windows systems, including path handling, permissions, and system integration.

## Scope

- Implement Windows path handling
- Handle Windows permissions and UAC
- Optimize Windows-specific operations
- Ensure proper error handling

## Status

- Current Phase: Not Started
- Progress: 0%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-19

## Implementation Details

### Path Handling Implementation

- Implement Windows path separator handling
- Handle Windows drive letters and UNC paths
- Ensure proper path normalization
- Handle Windows-specific path length limitations

### Permissions and UAC

- Implement proper UAC elevation checks
- Handle Windows file permissions
- Set up proper executable permissions
- Implement permission escalation requests

### System Integration

- Handle Windows environment variables
- Implement Windows registry integration if needed
- Configure Windows shell integration
- Handle Windows-specific process management

### Error Handling

- Implement Windows-specific error messages
- Handle Windows system errors
- Create Windows-specific troubleshooting flows
- Implement proper error recovery

## Dependencies

- Windows Build Infrastructure Task: Required for basic Windows support
- Core Extraction Project: Required for proper separation of core and CLI functionality

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

Anticipated challenges include:

- Path separator differences between platforms
- Windows-specific permission models
- UAC integration and elevation
- Windows filesystem peculiarities
- Process and shell integration differences

Solutions will be documented as they are implemented.

## Success Criteria

- All paths are handled correctly on Windows
- Proper UAC integration works
- File permissions are handled correctly
- System integration functions properly
- Error messages are Windows-appropriate
- All Windows-specific operations work as expected

## Notes

This task focuses on making dfx-cli work naturally on Windows systems, ensuring that Windows users have the same quality of experience as users on other platforms.

Key considerations:

- Windows filesystem conventions
- Security and permissions model
- System integration requirements
- User experience consistency
- Error handling clarity
