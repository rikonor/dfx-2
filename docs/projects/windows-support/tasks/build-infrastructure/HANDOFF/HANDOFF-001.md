# Windows Build Infrastructure Implementation

## Changes Made

Added Windows support to the CI/CD pipeline with the following changes:

1. Build Matrix Updates

   - Added `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` target
   - Configured Windows-specific build step using PowerShell
   - Added proper line continuation syntax for Windows

2. Artifact Handling

   - Updated artifact collection to handle .exe files
   - Modified release process to properly name Windows binaries
   - Ensured proper checksum generation for Windows artifacts

3. Release Integration
   - Added Windows target to release TARGETS array
   - Updated artifact naming to include .exe extension for Windows
   - Integrated Windows binaries into GitHub release process

## Implementation Details

### Build Configuration

- Added Windows-specific build step with PowerShell shell
- Used backtick (\`) for PowerShell line continuation
- Maintained Unix-style build step for other platforms

### Artifact Management

- Modified artifact path pattern to capture .exe files
- Updated artifact naming logic in release job
- Preserved existing artifact handling for other platforms

### Release Process

- Added conditional handling for Windows binary names
- Updated environment variable handling for Windows artifacts
- Maintained existing checksum generation process

## Future Considerations

1. Binary Signing

   - Windows binaries may require code signing for better security
   - Could implement Authenticode signing process
   - Would need to manage signing certificates

2. Testing Strategy
   - Basic smoke tests could be added in future
   - Cross-platform compatibility testing
   - Windows-specific edge cases

## Status

- Implementation Complete ✅
- Core Requirements Met ✅
- Ready for Production Use ✅

## Notes

The implementation focuses on essential build infrastructure while maintaining compatibility with existing macOS and Linux builds. Future improvements can be made iteratively based on actual usage and requirements.
