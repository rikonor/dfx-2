# Windows Build Infrastructure Task

## Overview

Add Windows platform support to the icp-cli build system and CI pipeline, enabling automated builds and releases of Windows binaries.

## Scope

- Add Windows target to build system
- Configure Windows CI pipeline
- Implement Windows artifact handling
- Set up release packaging for Windows

## Status

- Current Phase: Complete
- Progress: 100%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-20

Windows build infrastructure is fully implemented with automated builds and releases working in CI pipeline.

## Implementation Details

### Windows Target Configuration

✓ Added x86_64-pc-windows-msvc target to build matrix
✓ Configured Windows build environment using windows-2025 runner
✓ Set up proper handling of .exe extensions
✓ Integrated with existing build scripts

### CI Pipeline Updates

✓ Configured Windows build environment in GitHub Actions
✓ Integrated Windows builds into main CI pipeline
✓ Set up proper dependency handling
✓ Enabled parallel builds across all platforms

### Artifact Handling

✓ Implemented proper .exe extension handling
✓ Configured artifact paths for Windows binaries
✓ Set up automated packaging for Windows releases
✓ Integrated checksum generation for all artifacts

### Release Integration

✓ Updated release scripts to handle Windows artifacts
✓ Implemented proper Windows binary naming
✓ Integrated Windows builds into release process
✓ Added automated checksum verification

## Dependencies

- Core Extraction Project: Required for proper separation of core and CLI functionality
- CLI Simplification Task: Required for clean command handling

## Technical Solutions

The following solutions were successfully implemented:

- Build Environment: Configured windows-2025 runner with x86_64-pc-windows-msvc target
- Artifact Handling: Automated .exe extension management and proper Windows binary naming
- Release Process: Integrated Windows builds into unified release pipeline with proper checksums
- Cross-Platform Support: Unified build process working across all supported platforms

## Success Criteria

✓ Windows builds succeed automatically in CI
✓ Windows artifacts are properly named and packaged
✓ Release process handles Windows binaries correctly
✓ Checksums are generated and verified
✓ Cross-platform build process works reliably

## Notes

The build infrastructure for Windows support is now complete and operational. Future Windows-specific functionality and optimizations will be handled in the Windows Compatibility task.

Key achievements:

- Reliable Windows builds in CI pipeline
- Automated artifact handling and packaging
- Integrated release process
- Cross-platform build compatibility
