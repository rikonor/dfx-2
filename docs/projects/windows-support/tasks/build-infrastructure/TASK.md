# Windows Build Infrastructure Task

## Overview

Add Windows platform support to the dfx-cli build system and CI pipeline, enabling automated builds and releases of Windows binaries.

## Scope

- Add Windows target to build system
- Configure Windows CI pipeline
- Implement Windows artifact handling
- Set up release packaging for Windows

## Status

- Current Phase: In Progress
- Progress: 80%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-19

Core infrastructure is in place with Windows builds integrated into CI pipeline. Binary signing and testing framework will be addressed in separate phases.

## Implementation Details

### Windows Target Configuration

- Add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc target to build matrix
- Configure Windows-specific build flags and optimizations
- Set up proper handling of .exe extensions
- Implement Windows-specific build scripts if needed

### CI Pipeline Updates

- Add windows-latest runner to GitHub Actions
- Configure Windows build environment
- Set up Windows-specific dependencies
- Implement Windows build caching

### Artifact Handling

- Configure Windows binary naming (.exe extension)
- Set up proper artifact paths for Windows
- Implement Windows-specific packaging
- Configure checksum generation for Windows artifacts

### Release Integration

- Update release scripts for Windows artifacts
- Configure Windows binary signing
- Set up Windows-specific release notes
- Implement Windows release verification

## Dependencies

- Core Extraction Project: Required for proper separation of core and CLI functionality
- CLI Simplification Task: Required for clean command handling

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

Anticipated challenges include:

- Windows path handling in build scripts
- Binary signing requirements for Windows
- Windows-specific build environment setup
- Cross-platform build script compatibility

Solutions implemented:

- Windows path handling: Using PowerShell for Windows builds with proper line continuation
- Build environment: Configured windows-latest runner with proper target
- Cross-platform compatibility: Separate build steps for Windows and Unix platforms

## Success Criteria

- Windows builds succeed automatically in CI
- Windows artifacts are properly named and packaged
- Release process handles Windows binaries correctly
- All builds pass basic smoke tests
- Binary signing works correctly
- Checksums are generated properly

## Notes

This task focuses on the build infrastructure aspects of Windows support. Platform-specific functionality will be handled in the Windows Compatibility task.

Key considerations:

- Build script portability
- Windows environment setup
- Binary compatibility
- Release process integration
