## Project Overview

The Distribution project aims to make icp easily accessible to users through familiar installation methods on each platform. This includes a quick curl-based installation, native package managers, and comprehensive documentation.

## Current Focus

Implementation of the quick installation scripts and infrastructure is nearly complete. We've created the `icp-distribution` crate with template-based script generation and set up GitHub Actions for automated deployment to GitHub Pages. The next phase involves setting up package managers for multiple platforms and improving documentation.

## Next Steps

1. Documentation preparation:

   - Platform compatibility matrix
   - Installation guide templates
   - Security documentation

2. Quick Install implementation:

   - ✅ Shell script development
   - ✅ PowerShell script development
   - ✅ Create `icp-distribution` crate
   - ✅ GitHub Pages configuration
   - ✅ GitHub Actions workflow setup
   - ✅ Landing page template
   - Domain setup
   - Security measures implementation

3. Package manager setup:
   - Start with Homebrew
   - Expand to other platforms
   - Automate release process

## Dependencies

This project builds on the existing CI workflow that produces cross-platform releases.

## Known Issues

1. Domain acquisition for get.icp-cli.com needed
2. Package signing requirements vary by platform
3. Version synchronization across package managers

## Timeline

Quick Install and initial documentation: 2-3 weeks
Package manager integration: 4-6 weeks (parallel development)
