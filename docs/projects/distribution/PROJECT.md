## Project Overview

The Distribution project aims to make dfx-2 easily accessible to users through familiar installation methods on each platform. This includes a quick curl-based installation, native package managers, and comprehensive documentation.

## Current Focus

Initial focus will be on the quick installation method and documentation, followed by package manager integration. This approach ensures users have immediate access while we build out platform-specific packages.

## Next Steps

1. Documentation preparation:

   - Platform compatibility matrix
   - Installation guide templates
   - Security documentation

2. Quick Install implementation:

   - Shell script development
   - Domain setup
   - Security measures

3. Package manager setup:
   - Start with Homebrew
   - Expand to other platforms
   - Automate release process

## Dependencies

This project builds on the existing CI workflow that produces cross-platform releases.

## Known Issues

1. Domain acquisition for get.icp-cli.com needed
2. Package signing requirements vary by platform
3. Version synchronization across package managers

## Timeline

Quick Install and initial documentation: 2-3 weeks
Package manager integration: 4-6 weeks (parallel development)
