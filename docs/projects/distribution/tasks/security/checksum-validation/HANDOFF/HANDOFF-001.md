# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

Checksum validation for extensions has been fully implemented and tested.

## Completed Work

- Added --checksum parameter to extension add command
- Implemented SHA256 validation during installation
- Added clear error messages for checksum mismatches
- Updated test cases to include checksum field
- Verified functionality with both valid and invalid checksums

## Technical Details

- Uses SHA256 algorithm for checksum verification
- Checksum parameter is optional but strictly validated when provided
- Checksum stored in manifest for future reference
- Invalid checksums fail installation with clear error message

## Challenges

- Needed to handle both local and remote extension files
- Required updates to test cases to accommodate new checksum field
- Had to create proper WASM components for testing

## Next Steps

- Documentation updates for users
- Potential integration with package manager tasks

## Guidelines Audit

- [Code Quality] Followed error handling standards
  - Clear error messages for checksum mismatches
  - Proper use of Result types
- [Testing] Comprehensive test coverage
  - Verified both success and failure cases
  - Used realistic test files
