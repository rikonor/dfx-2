# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-004

## Current State

Successfully implemented extension installation in the Homebrew formula. The formula now automatically installs both the multiply and power extensions during post-install, making the CLI fully functional out of the box for Homebrew users.

## Completed Work

- Added extension installation commands to post_install hook
- Implemented error handling for extension installation
- Tested complete installation flow via Homebrew
- Verified extension installation works as expected

## Technical Details

Updated formula post_install implementation:

```ruby
def post_install
  begin
    system "#{bin}/icp", "extension", "add", "--name", "multiply", "https://github.com/rikonor/icp-cli/releases/download/v1.0.1/multiply.component.wasm"
    system "#{bin}/icp", "extension", "add", "--name", "power", "https://github.com/rikonor/icp-cli/releases/download/v1.0.1/power.component.wasm"
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "Error installing extensions: #{e.message}"
  end
end
```

Key implementation points:

- Uses `system` to execute shell commands
- References installed binary using `#{bin}/icp`
- Maintains error handling with begin/rescue block
- Installs both extensions sequentially

## Next Steps

Focus on CI Integration subtask:

1. Setup workflow to update homebrew-icp-cli repository
2. Implement version synchronization between repos
3. Configure automated testing
4. Test release process

## Notes

The formula is now working as intended, with successful testing of the complete installation flow including extension installation. The next phase will focus on automating updates between the main repository and the Homebrew tap.
