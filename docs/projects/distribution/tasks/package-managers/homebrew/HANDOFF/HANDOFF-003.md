# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-003

## Current State

Completed Build Integration subtask and made significant progress on Formula Creation. The build system now properly handles distribution variants through environment variables, and we have a working basic Homebrew formula template.

## Completed Work

- Updated release workflow to use DISTRIBUTION environment variable
- Added documentation for variant field in matrix configuration
- Removed unused build_args placeholders
- Created initial Homebrew formula with multi-architecture support

## Technical Details

Build Integration:

- Uses DISTRIBUTION environment variable to configure builds
- Matrix variant field determines distribution type
- Works across all platforms (Windows using PowerShell syntax)

Formula Template:

```ruby
class IcpCli < Formula
  desc "CLI tool for Internet Computer with WebAssembly component-based extensions"
  homepage "https://github.com/rikonor/icp-cli"
  version "0.1.5"
  license "MIT"

  on_macos do
    on_arm do
      url "https://github.com/rikonor/icp-cli/releases/download/v1.0.1/icp-aarch64-apple-darwin-homebrew"
      sha256 "cfec309c6477bc9cebb1c039eebad627d84043466119f0f67c686414c50e1b56"
    end
    on_intel do
      url "https://github.com/rikonor/icp-cli/releases/download/v1.0.1/icp-x86_64-apple-darwin-homebrew"
      sha256 "9ace358475a4a50256edd657278830dfbd380faa652ea08c89e39b5c4b2db027"
    end
  end

  def install
    downloaded_name = File.basename(stable.url)
    bin.install downloaded_name => "icp"
  end

  def post_install
    begin
    rescue StandardError => e
      puts "Other error: #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end
```

## Next Steps

Focus on Formula Creation subtask:

- Implement post_install hook for extension management
- Test complete installation flow
- Verify proper path handling in Homebrew context

## Notes

The formula template is working for basic installation. Next session will focus on implementing extension management through the post_install hook.
