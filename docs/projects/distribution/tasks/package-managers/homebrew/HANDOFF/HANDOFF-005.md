# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-005

## Current State

Successfully implemented template-based Homebrew formula generation with the following components:

1. Formula Template System:

   - Location: crates/icp-distribution/templates/homebrew/formula.rb.tmpl
   - Handles both Intel and ARM architectures
   - Supports extension installation

2. Generation Infrastructure:

   - HomebrewFormulaContext for type-safe template data
   - generate_formula binary for CLI usage
   - Error handling for JSON parsing and template rendering

3. GitHub Action Integration:
   - Uses GitHub CLI for release asset handling
   - Generates context JSON from release data
   - Uses our new template system

## Completed Work

- Added Homebrew formula template to icp-distribution
- Created generate_formula binary
- Added HomebrewFormulaContext and related types
- Implemented proper error handling
- Updated GitHub Action to use template system
- Removed Ruby script in favor of template approach

## Technical Details

Key implementation points:

1. Template Context:

   ```rust
   pub struct HomebrewFormulaContext {
       pub version: String,
       pub intel_binary: BinaryAsset,
       pub arm_binary: BinaryAsset,
       pub extensions: Vec<ExtensionAsset>,
   }
   ```

2. GitHub Action Flow:
   - Fetch release assets and URLs
   - Generate context JSON with binary and extension info
   - Use generate_formula to create formula
   - Update tap repository

## Next Steps

1. Testing:

   - Create test release with homebrew variants
   - Test formula generation locally
   - Test in GitHub environment
   - Verify installation works

2. Documentation:
   - Update installation guides
   - Document formula generation process
   - Add troubleshooting section

## Notes

The implementation leverages existing distribution infrastructure and provides a maintainable, testable solution for keeping the Homebrew formula up to date. Changes are pending verification in the GitHub environment.

## Guidelines Audit

Guidelines followed:

- Project organization: Added template to appropriate location
- Code quality: Implemented proper error handling and type safety
- Documentation: Added inline documentation and tests
- Incremental changes: Split implementation into logical components

New guideline suggestions:

- Consider adding template validation guidelines
- Document GitHub Actions authentication patterns
