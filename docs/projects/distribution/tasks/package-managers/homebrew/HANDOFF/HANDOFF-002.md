# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-002

## Current State

Completed Distribution Framework Implementation and Path Configuration subtasks. The system now supports distribution-aware path resolution with a focus on Homebrew integration.

## Completed Work

- Added Distribution enum to icp-distribution crate

  - Implemented FromStr for string parsing
  - Added TryFrom implementation for build-time validation
  - Added error handling for invalid distribution values
  - Added tests for distribution parsing

- Added build.rs to icp-cli for compile-time validation

  - Validates DISTRIBUTION environment variable
  - Provides compile-time defaults

- Implemented distribution-aware paths in icp-cli
  - Added static DISTRIBUTION configuration
  - Implemented Homebrew-specific path resolution using brew --prefix
  - Added path handling for manifest, extensions, and precompiles
  - Structured paths according to Homebrew conventions:
    - manifest.json: $(brew --prefix)/var/icp/manifest.json
    - extensions: $(brew --prefix)/var/icp/extensions
    - precompiles: $(brew --prefix)/var/icp/precompiles

## Next Steps

Begin Build Integration subtask:

- Add DISTRIBUTION environment variable support to build process
- Update Makefile/build scripts
- Add distribution-specific build tests

## Technical Details

Distribution Framework Design:

```rust
pub enum Distribution {
    Standard,
    Homebrew,
    NuGet,
    Apt,
}
```

Path Resolution Strategy:

- Standard: Uses ~/.icp for manifest and cache directories
- Homebrew: Uses brew --prefix for base path
  - manifest.json: $(brew --prefix)/var/icp/manifest.json
  - extensions: $(brew --prefix)/var/icp/extensions
  - precompiles: $(brew --prefix)/var/icp/precompiles

## Notes

The distribution-aware build system provides a foundation for supporting multiple package managers beyond Homebrew, while ensuring each variant can properly handle extension management within its environment's constraints.

## Guidelines Audit

Guidelines followed in this session:

- [Code Quality Standards] Error Handling

  - Added proper error variants for distribution validation
  - Implemented fallbacks for missing environment variables

- [Documentation Standards] Code Documentation

  - Added doc comments explaining Distribution enum
  - Documented path resolution strategy

- [Best Practices] Code Modification
  - Used replace_in_file for targeted changes
  - Made changes in small, logical increments

Guidelines that could have been better applied:

- [Testing Requirements] Integration Tests
  - Could add more tests for path resolution
  - Need tests for brew --prefix integration

New guideline suggestions:

- Consider adding "Distribution-Specific Testing" guideline
  - Document how to test package manager integrations
  - Define environment setup requirements
