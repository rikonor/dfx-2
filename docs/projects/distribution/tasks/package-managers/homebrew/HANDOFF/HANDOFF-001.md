# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

Completed initial project management cleanup and task restructuring. The homebrew task is now ready for implementation with a clear sequence of subtasks and detailed technical approach using the distribution-aware build system.

## Completed Work

- Updated project documentation to use subtask-based approach instead of percentages
- Created detailed implementation plan for distribution-aware build system
- Structured homebrew task into clear, sequential subtasks
- Added Guidelines Audit section to handoff template

## Technical Details

- Distribution Framework Design:

  ```rust
  pub enum Distribution {
      Standard,
      Homebrew,
      NuGet,
      Apt,
  }
  ```

  - Build-time validation through build.rs
  - Distribution-specific path handling
  - Integration with existing icp-distribution crate

- Path Configuration Strategy:
  - Use `brew --prefix` for Homebrew paths
  - Handle extension installation within Homebrew context
  - Maintain compatibility with standard installation

## Next Steps

1. Begin Distribution Framework Implementation subtask:

   - Add Distribution enum to icp-distribution crate
   - Implement TryFrom for distribution parsing
   - Add build.rs for distribution validation
   - Add tests for distribution parsing

2. Prepare for Path Configuration subtask:
   - Research brew --prefix integration
   - Plan path resolution strategy
   - Design test cases

## Notes

The distribution-aware build system provides a foundation for supporting multiple package managers beyond Homebrew, while ensuring each variant can properly handle extension management within its environment's constraints.

## Guidelines Audit

Guidelines followed in this session:

- [Project Organization] Task directory structure

  - Created proper task structure with TASK.md and HANDOFF directory
  - Impact: Clear organization and documentation

- [Documentation Standards] Task documentation

  - Created detailed TASK.md with clear subtasks and success criteria
  - Impact: Better task comprehension and tracking

- [Best Practices] Code Modification

  - Used replace_in_file for targeted changes
  - Impact: Maintained file history and structure

- [Working Process] Session workflow
  - Reviewed existing documentation
  - Made incremental changes
  - Created proper handoff
  - Impact: Smooth transition to next session

Guidelines that could have been better applied:

- [Working Process] Review Handoffs
  - Could have reviewed quick-install handoffs earlier in the session
  - Impact: Delayed learning from previous task experiences

New guideline suggestions:

- Consider adding a "Cross-Task Learning" guideline
  - Document learnings from one task that could benefit other tasks
  - Example: Distribution framework design could inform other package manager tasks
