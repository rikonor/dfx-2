# Quick Install Task

## Overview

Create a curl-based installation method for icp that works across all supported platforms, similar to popular tools that offer `curl -sL https://get.example.com | sh` installation.

## Scope

- Shell script for Unix-like systems
- PowerShell variant for Windows
- Platform/architecture detection
- Binary selection and verification
- Domain setup (get.icp-cli.com)
- Security measures implementation

## Status

- Current Phase: In Progress
- Progress: 97%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-22

## Implementation Details

### Script Development

- ✅ Cross-platform shell script (install.sh)
- ✅ PowerShell script for Windows (install.ps1)
- ✅ Platform detection logic
- ✅ Binary selection and verification
- ✅ Error handling and feedback

### Infrastructure

- Domain registration and setup (get.icp-cli.com)
- ✅ GitHub Pages configuration for static file hosting
  - Using .nojekyll for direct file serving
  - No Jekyll processing required
  - Secure, efficient distribution of binaries and scripts
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
  - Generates installation scripts and landing page from templates
  - Processes and verifies binary artifacts
  - Creates checksums for security
  - Deploys to gh-pages branch
  - Validates all generated files
- SSL certificate configuration (via GitHub Pages)

### File Organization

- ✅ Templates in icp-distribution crate
  - install.sh.tmpl and install.ps1.tmpl for installation scripts
  - Landing page template for documentation
- ✅ Script generation system
  - Centralized in generate_scripts.rs
  - Handles template rendering
  - Creates all necessary deployment files
- ✅ Deployment structure
  - All files generated during deployment
  - No static copies in documentation
  - Single source of truth in templates

### Distribution Crate Development

- ✅ Create new `icp-distribution` crate
- ✅ Implement template system for installation scripts
- ✅ Convert existing scripts to templates
- ✅ Setup build integration for script generation

## Dependencies

- GitHub release artifacts
- Domain registration
- SSL certificates

## Technical Challenges

- Cross-platform compatibility
- Security verification
- Error handling
- Platform detection reliability

## Success Criteria

- Installation works on all platforms
- Security measures implemented
- Clear error handling
- User-friendly experience
- Extensions are discoverable and easy to install

## Extension Support

### Phase 1 (✅ Completed)

- Basic extension listing on landing page
  - ✅ Display extension names from filenames
  - ✅ Provide download links
  - ✅ Simple installation instructions
  - ✅ Foundation for future metadata support

### Phase 2 (In Progress)

- Enhanced extension management
  - ✅ Display installation commands with copy functionality
  - ✅ Improve checksum handling and verification
  - ✅ Refactor checksums file location
  - Add visual indicators for security features
    - Success/failure icons
    - Color coding for verification state
    - Tooltips for verification details

### Future Phases

- Extension metadata extraction
- Interface documentation display
- Usage examples and documentation
- Installation automation

## Notes

Focus on security and reliability while keeping the installation process simple and user-friendly. The extension support should follow the same principles, starting with basic functionality that can be enhanced over time.
