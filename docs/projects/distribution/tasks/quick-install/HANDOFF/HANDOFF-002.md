# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-002

## Current State

The `icp-distribution` crate has been created and implemented with template-based script generation. The existing shell and PowerShell scripts have been converted to templates, and a build integration system has been set up to generate the scripts during the build process.

## Completed Work

- Created new `icp-distribution` crate with the following structure:

  - `src/lib.rs`: Core template rendering functionality
  - `src/bin/generate_scripts.rs`: CLI tool for script generation
  - `templates/curl-install/`: Directory containing templates
  - `build.rs`: Build script integration

- Implemented template system for installation scripts:

  - Added Handlebars-based template rendering
  - Created parameterized templates for both Unix and Windows scripts
  - Added support for variables (version, paths, URLs, etc.)

- Converted existing scripts to templates:

  - `install.sh.tmpl`: Unix shell script template
  - `install.ps1.tmpl`: Windows PowerShell script template

- Setup build integration:
  - Updated workspace Cargo.toml to include the new crate
  - Added build.rs script for integration with the build process
  - Created binary for script generation

## Technical Details

- The template system uses Handlebars for variable substitution with the following template variables:

  - `{{version}}`: ICP CLI version
  - `{{install_dir}}`: Installation directory
  - `{{binary_name}}`: Binary filename
  - `{{binary_url_base}}`: Base URL for binary downloads
  - `{{checksum_url_base}}`: Base URL for checksum files

- The build integration system works as follows:

  - During cargo build (release mode), the build.rs script runs
  - The build script creates the necessary directory structure
  - The generate_scripts binary is called to render templates
  - Scripts are output to the dist/ directory

- Templates maintain all security features from the original scripts:
  - HTTPS downloads
  - Checksum verification
  - Privilege checks
  - Permission verification
  - Comprehensive error handling

## Challenges

- Ensuring templates maintain all security features of the original scripts
- Setting up appropriate paths for template loading during development/build
- Integrating script generation into the build process

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub Pages infrastructure:

   - Create a gh-pages branch in the repository
   - Configure GitHub repository settings for Pages
   - Set up directory structure for hosting scripts and binaries

2. Configure the custom domain:

   - Register the domain get.icp-cli.com
   - Configure DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages
   - Setup SSL certificate through GitHub Pages

3. Create a deployment workflow:
   - Set up GitHub Action for automated deployment
   - Ensure scripts are properly copied to the gh-pages branch
   - Test the curl-based installation process end-to-end

## Notes

- The templates are ready for use but require a hosting infrastructure to be fully functional
- The domain setup (get.icp-cli.com) is a critical dependency for the scripts to work properly
- Consider adding a GitHub Action workflow to generate scripts and publish them automatically to GitHub Pages
- Test the installation process thoroughly once the hosting is set up
