# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

Initial implementation of cross-platform installation scripts is complete, and a plan for distribution crate development has been established. We've created a PowerShell script for Windows and a shell script for Unix-like systems, along with detailed documentation about the installation process.

The next phase will involve creating a dedicated `icp-distribution` crate for managing installation scripts and other distribution concerns across various package managers.

## Completed Work

- Created installation script for Windows (`install.ps1`) with:

  - Platform detection
  - Binary download and verification
  - PATH configuration
  - Error handling and user feedback

- Created installation script for Unix-like systems (`install.sh`) with:

  - Platform/architecture detection
  - Binary download and verification
  - Permission handling
  - Shell profile configuration

- Added comprehensive README detailing:
  - Installation methods for each platform
  - Security features
  - Script behavior
  - Required infrastructure

## Technical Details

- Installation scripts are designed to be invoked via:

  - Windows: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://get.icp-cli.com/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1`
  - Unix: `curl -sL https://get.icp-cli.com/install.sh | sh`

- Security implementations include:

  - HTTPS for all downloads
  - SHA-256 checksum verification
  - Privilege/permission checks
  - Clear error reporting

- Future hosting will be via GitHub Pages with a custom domain (get.icp-cli.com)

## Challenges

- Cross-platform compatibility requirements led to two separate scripts
- Security considerations required careful handling of permissions and checksums
- The need for a more sustainable long-term solution led to planning a distribution crate

## Next Steps

1. Create a new `icp-distribution` crate with minimal functionality:

   ```
   /crates/icp-distribution/
   ├── Cargo.toml         # With minimal dependencies (handlebars, serde)
   ├── README.md          # Simple documentation
   ├── src/
   │   └── lib.rs         # Basic template rendering functionality
   └── templates/
       └── curl-install/  # Templates for quick install scripts
           ├── install.ps1.tmpl
           └── install.sh.tmpl
   ```

2. Implement basic template rendering in `lib.rs`:

   ```rust
   use handlebars::Handlebars;
   use serde::Serialize;
   use std::collections::HashMap;
   use std::fs;
   use std::path::Path;

   // Basic template rendering function
   pub fn render_template(
       template_name: &str,
       template_path: &Path,
       output_path: &Path,
       values: HashMap<String, String>,
   ) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
       let template_content = fs::read_to_string(template_path)?;
       let mut handlebars = Handlebars::new();
       handlebars.register_template_string(template_name, template_content)?;

       let rendered = handlebars.render(template_name, &values)?;
       fs::create_dir_all(output_path.parent().unwrap())?;
       fs::write(output_path, rendered)?;

       Ok(())
   }
   ```

3. Convert existing scripts to templates with variables for:

   - Version information
   - Repository details
   - Binary URLs
   - Checksum URLs

4. Setup GitHub Pages hosting:
   - Create a gh-pages branch
   - Configure GitHub repository for Pages
   - Setup workflow to deploy scripts

## Notes

The long-term vision is for the `icp-distribution` crate to handle distribution across multiple package managers (Homebrew, APT, Chocolatey, NuGet, NPM) with consistent versioning and templates. Start with the minimal implementation described above, focusing on the curl-based quick install scripts first.

Future enhancements could include:

- Automatic checksum generation
- Version detection from Cargo.toml
- Support for more package managers
- Build integration
