# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-011

## Current State

The extension support for the quick-install page has been implemented with basic functionality:

- Added ExtensionInfo struct to handle extension metadata
- Updated BinaryProcessor to handle extensions in a separate directory
- Modified generate_scripts.rs to support extensions path
- Added extensions section to landing page template
- Added VS Code configuration to properly handle Handlebars templates

## Completed Work

- Added ExtensionInfo struct in binary.rs
- Implemented with_extensions_path() method for BinaryProcessor
- Updated generate_scripts.rs to accept --extensions-path argument
- Added extensions section to index.html.tmpl with download cards
- Created .vscode/settings.json to handle template syntax highlighting
- Successfully tested local generation with test extensions

## Next Steps

### 1. Checksums File Location Refactoring

- Add new CLI argument for checksums file path
- Update CI workflow to place checksums.txt in a more logical location (e.g., dist/checksums.txt)
- Modify BinaryProcessor to use the specified checksums file
- Update documentation to reflect the new file structure

### 2. Extension Installation Commands

- Update extension cards to show installation commands instead of download links
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for commands
- Command format: `icp extension add --name <name> <url>`
- Consider adding CSS styles for command display and copy button

### 3. Extension Checksums

- Ensure checksums are properly read and displayed for extensions
- Verify checksum handling in BinaryProcessor
- Add error handling for missing checksums
- Consider adding visual indicators for verified checksums

### 4. Additional Improvements

- Consider adding extension descriptions or metadata
- Improve error handling for extension processing
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation with extension management details

## Technical Details

### Extension Command Display

```html
<div class="command-box">
  <code>icp extension add --name {{name}} {{url}}</code>
  <button class="copy-button" data-command="...">Copy</button>
</div>
```

### Proposed Checksums Structure

```
dist/
├── binaries/
│   ├── icp/
│   │   └── icp-x86_64-apple-darwin
│   └── extensions/
│       ├── multiply.component.wasm
│       └── power.component.wasm
└── checksums.txt
```

## Notes

The focus for the next session should be on improving the user experience for extension installation and ensuring proper security through checksum verification. The command-line interface for extension management should be prominently displayed and easy to use.
