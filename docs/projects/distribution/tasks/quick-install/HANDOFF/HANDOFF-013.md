## Current State

The extension presentation in the quick-install page has been improved with better styling and fixed checksum display:

- Fixed checksum display by correcting checksums file format
- Enhanced extension card layout and styling
- Improved command presentation with multi-line format

## Completed Work

- Fixed checksum generation in Makefile

  - Corrected format to properly associate checksums with extensions
  - Removed incorrect binary name inclusion in extension entries
  - Added proper separation of checksum entries

- Improved extension card styling

  - Made cards full width for better readability
  - Removed hover effects for cleaner appearance
  - Added proper spacing and margins
  - Ensured consistent width with page content

- Enhanced command presentation
  - Reformatted commands to use multi-line format for clarity
  - Added copy button in corner with icon
  - Improved command box styling
  - Added proper padding for command text

## Technical Details

- Checksum file format updated to:

  ```
  [checksum] [filename]
  ```

  No longer includes binary name in extension entries

- Command format changed to:

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Phase 2 items:

   - Add visual indicators for checksum verification status
     - Success/failure icons
     - Color coding for verification state
     - Tooltips for verification details
   - Improve error handling for verification failures
     - Clear error messages
     - User-friendly feedback
     - Recovery suggestions

2. Prepare for Phase 3:
   - Plan extension metadata display
   - Consider documentation integration
   - Design usage examples presentation

## Notes

The extension installation experience is now more polished with proper checksum display and improved command presentation. Focus should shift to enhancing the security aspects through better verification status indicators.
