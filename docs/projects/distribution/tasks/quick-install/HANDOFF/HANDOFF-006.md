# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-006

## Current State

Landing page template restored and integrated into build process.

## Completed Work

- Restored index.html template from git history
- Added template to icp-distribution/templates/
- Updated generate_scripts to handle landing page generation
- Added template variables for GitHub Pages URL and repo

## Technical Details

- Template uses variables: {{github_pages_url}}, {{github_repo_url}}
- Integrated with existing script generation process
- Added validation for landing page generation
- Template includes:
  - Platform-specific installation instructions
  - Security notes and verification steps
  - Manual download options
  - Responsive styling

## Challenges

- Original template was removed in favor of runtime generation
- Had to restore from git history and convert to template format
- Needed to align with existing template variable pattern

## Next Steps

- Test the landing page generation with generate_scripts
- Verify template variables are correctly replaced
- Consider adding more customization options through variables
- Update workflow to remove basic index.html generation

## Notes

The landing page was previously in quick-install task directory but is now properly integrated into the template system. This change aligns with the project's approach to template-based file generation and makes maintenance easier.
