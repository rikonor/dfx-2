# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-009

## Current State

The quick-install functionality has been updated to properly filter binaries and prepare for extension support. We've modified both the action and workflow to handle standard binaries and extensions separately.

## Completed Work

- Updated quick-install action with new inputs:
  - `icp_binaries`: List of standard ICP binary files to include
  - `extension_binaries`: List of extension files (prepared for future use)
- Modified download step to only fetch specified files
- Added workflow steps to filter binaries:
  - Get standard ICP binaries using `grep standard`
  - Get extension files using `grep .wasm`
- Fixed installation URLs in index.html template

## Technical Details

- Extension Preparation:
  - Currently downloading extension files but not displaying them
  - Files are stored in the same directory as ICP binaries
  - Using simple `.wasm` file detection for now

## Next Steps

For the extension section, we should:

1. Enhance Extension Metadata:

   - Add a step in the workflow to extract extension metadata:
     - Name and version from the component
     - Interface definitions (WIT)
     - Description and capabilities
   - Could use `wasm-tools component wit` to extract interface info

2. Update Template Structure:

   - Add a new section in index.html.tmpl for extensions
   - Design a card-based layout similar to binaries section
   - Include:
     - Extension name and version
     - Brief description
     - Interface capabilities
     - Download link
     - Checksum verification

3. Modify Action:

   - Update `extension_binaries` input to accept metadata
   - Consider JSON format for rich extension data
   - Example structure:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "multiply",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "description": "Basic multiplication extension",
       "interfaces": ["math/multiply/1.0"],
       "file": "multiply.component.wasm",
       "checksum": "sha256-..."
     }
     ```

4. Update Workflow:
   - Add step to generate extension metadata
   - Pass structured data to quick-install action
   - Ensure checksums are properly handled

## Notes

The current changes provide a solid foundation for adding extension support. The separation of binaries and extensions in the workflow and action makes it easy to enhance the extension handling without affecting the existing binary distribution.
