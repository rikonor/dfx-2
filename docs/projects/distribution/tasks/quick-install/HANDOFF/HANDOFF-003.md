# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-003

## Current State

The quick-install task is now approximately 90% complete. We've implemented the GitHub Actions workflow for deploying installation scripts to GitHub Pages, updated the installation page to use the GitHub Pages URL, and configured the necessary infrastructure for automated deployment.

## Completed Work

- Created GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-scripts.yml` with the following capabilities:

  - Triggers on release publishing or manual workflow dispatch
  - Builds the icp-distribution crate to generate installation scripts
  - Downloads release artifacts for the appropriate version
  - Processes binaries and creates checksums
  - Updates URLs in the landing page to use GitHub Pages
  - Deploys to the gh-pages branch

- Updated HTML landing page to use the GitHub Pages URL instead of a custom domain

  - Modified installation commands to use the GitHub Pages URL
  - Updated GitHub repository link

- Configured workflow to handle both:
  - Actual release artifacts for production use
  - Placeholder binaries for testing/development

## Technical Details

- The deployment workflow has the following structure:

  1. Checkout repository and set up Rust toolchain
  2. Extract version from release tag or manual input
  3. Build the icp-distribution crate to generate scripts
  4. Download release artifacts if available
  5. Process binaries and create checksums
  6. Update URLs in the landing page
  7. Deploy to GitHub Pages

- The placeholder "GITHUB_PAGES_URL" in the landing page will be replaced with the actual GitHub Pages URL during the CI deployment process using a sed command. This approach allows for local development while ensuring correct URLs in production.

- The workflow includes fallback mechanisms:
  - It creates placeholder binaries if real ones aren't available (for testing)
  - It handles missing binaries gracefully with error messages

## Challenges

- Ensuring the correct path structure for binary downloads from GitHub releases
- Incorporating flexible version handling to work with both automated and manual deployments
- Making the landing page work with both custom domain and GitHub Pages URLs

## Next Steps

1. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings:

   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Set the branch to gh-pages
   - Save the configuration

2. Test the workflow by triggering it manually:

   - Go to Actions → Deploy Installation Scripts → Run workflow
   - Provide a version number if needed
   - Verify the deployment process

3. Verify the installation process end-to-end:

   - Check the deployed GitHub Pages site
   - Test the curl-based installation command
   - Test the PowerShell installation command

4. Update the README.md with installation instructions:
   - Add a "Quick Installation" section
   - Include the curl-based installation command
   - Link to the GitHub Pages site for more information

## Notes

- The project is fully ready for GitHub Pages deployment without requiring a custom domain
- If a custom domain is desired in the future, only minor modifications would be needed:
  - Register domain get.icp-cli.com
  - Configure DNS settings
  - Add CNAME file to GitHub Pages
  - Update URL in workflow to use custom domain
- Consider adding cross-platform testing to verify installation scripts work on all supported platforms
