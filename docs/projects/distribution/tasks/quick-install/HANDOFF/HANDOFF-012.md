# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-012

## Current State

The extension support for the quick-install page has been enhanced with installation commands and testing infrastructure:

- Added copy-to-clipboard functionality for extension installation commands
- Improved styling for command display
- Added make target for easy testing

## Completed Work

- Updated landing page template with extension installation commands
  - Replaced download links with proper installation commands
  - Added copy-to-clipboard functionality
  - Added visual feedback for copy action
  - Improved styling for command boxes
- Added test-quick-install make target
  - Creates necessary directory structure in dist/
  - Generates test binaries and extensions
  - Creates checksums file
  - Runs generate_scripts
  - Provides instructions for viewing result

## Technical Details

- Extension installation commands use format:
  ```
  icp extension add --name <name> <url>
  ```
- Command boxes styled with:
  - Monospace font for commands
  - Copy button with hover effects
  - Success state indication
  - Proper spacing and alignment
- Test files are generated in dist/ directory (gitignored)
  - Automatic cleanup on git clean
  - No manual cleanup needed

## Next Steps

1. Add visual indicators for checksum verification status

   - Add icons or badges to show verification state
   - Consider color coding for verified/unverified
   - Add tooltips explaining verification status

2. Consider adding extension metadata display

   - Version information
   - Brief description
   - Dependencies
   - Usage examples

3. Improve error handling
   - Add clear error messages for failed checksum verification
   - Handle network errors gracefully
   - Provide user-friendly error feedback

## Notes

The extension installation UI is now more user-friendly with proper commands and copy functionality. The make target makes it easy to test changes to the landing page generation. Next focus should be on improving the security aspects with better checksum verification indicators.
