# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-008

## Current State

Completed major refactoring of the quick-install functionality:

- Moved core functionality into library modules
- Added proper binary validation and checksum verification
- Improved URL handling and template rendering
- Enhanced error handling and testing capabilities

## Completed Work

1. Created modular library structure:

   ```
   src/
   ├── lib.rs              # Public API and template rendering
   ├── error.rs            # Error types and handling
   ├── binary.rs           # Binary processing and validation
   └── url.rs              # URL construction and validation
   ```

2. Added dependencies:

   - Added sha2 for checksum verification
   - Added thiserror for better error handling

3. Enhanced binary validation:

   - Strict checksum verification
   - Proper filename format validation
   - Comprehensive error reporting

4. Improved URL handling:

   - Proper URL construction
   - Protocol handling
   - Domain validation

5. Updated GitHub Action:
   - Added file verification steps
   - Improved error handling
   - Better logging

## Technical Details

1. Binary Processing:

   - BinaryProcessor handles all binary-related operations
   - Validates checksums using SHA-256
   - Verifies filename format and structure

2. URL Management:

   - UrlBuilder manages all URL construction
   - Handles HTTPS protocol
   - Validates domain format

3. Error Handling:
   - Custom error types for each failure case
   - Proper error propagation
   - Descriptive error messages

## Challenges

1. Code Organization:

   - Resolved by creating focused modules
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Better testability

2. Error Handling:
   - Implemented custom error types
   - Added proper context to errors
   - Improved error reporting

## Next Steps

1. Testing:

   - Add integration tests for binary validation
   - Test URL construction edge cases
   - Add more template rendering tests

2. Documentation:

   - Add API documentation
   - Document error handling
   - Add usage examples

3. Deployment:
   - Test GitHub Pages deployment
   - Verify binary downloads
   - Test installation scripts

## Notes

The refactoring makes the code more maintainable and testable while improving error handling and validation. The next phase should focus on comprehensive testing and documentation.
