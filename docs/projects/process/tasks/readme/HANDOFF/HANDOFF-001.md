# README Creation Task Handoff - March 17, 2025

## Current State

Task has been initialized with basic structure and requirements defined. Implementation has not yet begun.

## Key Resources

1. **Project Documentation**:

   - [SUMMARY.md](../../../../../SUMMARY.md) - Contains comprehensive project overview
   - [GUIDELINES.md](../../../../../GUIDELINES.md) - Development guidelines and standards
   - [WORKFLOW.md](../../../../../WORKFLOW.md) - Project organization and workflow

2. **Important Technical Details**:
   - Project is a command-line utility for Internet Computer platform
   - Uses WebAssembly Component Model for extensions
   - Key components: Core CLI, WebAssembly Runtime, Extension Ecosystem

## Implementation Guide

### Suggested README Structure

```markdown
# dfx-2

## Overview

A command-line utility for the Internet Computer platform with WebAssembly extension support. dfx-2 enables powerful plugin capabilities through dynamically loaded WASM components while maintaining security and performance benefits.

## Features

- WebAssembly-based extension system
- Secure sandboxing for extensions
- Dynamic command-line interface
- Efficient extension management

## Command-line Interface

### Base Commands

\`\`\`bash

# List installed extensions

dfx-2 extension ls

# Add a new extension

dfx-2 extension add --name <name> <uri>

# Remove an extension

dfx-2 extension rm <name>
\`\`\`

### Extension Management

[Extension management documentation with examples...]
```

### Key Technical Points to Cover

1. **Project Overview Section**

   - Focus on the WebAssembly Component Model integration
   - Highlight extension capabilities
   - Explain target audience (IC developers)

2. **Command-line Interface**

   - Document base commands with real examples
   - Show common usage patterns
   - Include example output

3. **Extension Management**
   - Explain extension installation process
   - Cover extension storage locations
   - Document manifest structure

## Implementation Notes

1. **Content Sources**:

   - Use `crates/dfx-cli/src/main.rs` for command-line examples
   - Reference `crates/dfx-cli/wit/world.wit` for WebAssembly interface details
   - Check `crates/dfx-core/src/manifest/` for extension management details

2. **Code Examples**:

   ```rust
   // Example from main.rs showing command structure
   dfx-2 extension add --name hello-world ./hello-world.wasm
   dfx-2 extension ls
   ```

3. **Important Paths**:
   - Extensions: `$CACHE_DIR/dfx-2/extensions-dir/`
   - Precompiles: `$CACHE_DIR/dfx-2/precompiles-dir/`
   - Manifest: `$HOME/.dfx-2/manifest.json`

## Suggested Workflow

1. Start with the project overview section
2. Implement command-line interface documentation with examples
3. Add extension management guide
4. Review against SUMMARY.md to ensure accuracy
5. Test all command examples

## Additional Considerations

1. **User Perspective**:

   - Focus on practical usage
   - Include troubleshooting tips
   - Add examples of common workflows

2. **Documentation Style**:
   - Use clear, concise language
   - Include code blocks for all examples
   - Add explanatory comments where needed

## Next Steps

1. Draft initial README.md following the suggested structure
2. Validate command examples
3. Review with project maintainers
4. Integrate feedback and finalize

## Questions to Address During Implementation

1. Should installation instructions include platform-specific details?
2. Are there any common troubleshooting scenarios to document?
3. Should we include a development guide for extension creators?

## References

1. WebAssembly Component Model:

   - `docs/explainer/explainer-overview.md`
   - `docs/explainer/explainer-component-definitions.md`

2. Extension System:
   - `crates/dfx-cli/src/extension.rs`
   - `crates/dfx-core/src/manifest/model.rs`

## Final Notes

The goal is to create a README that serves as both a quick start guide and a gateway to more detailed documentation. Focus on making it accessible while providing clear paths to more detailed information in the docs directory.
