# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

The Crate Organization task has been created and defined. The task aims to establish a clear and organized directory structure for extensions and examples in the icp codebase.

## Completed Work

- Created task directory and documentation structure
- Defined requirements and acceptance criteria
- Proposed a directory structure for organizing extensions and examples
- Outlined implementation considerations and next steps

## Technical Details

- The proposed directory structure separates extensions, examples, and tools into distinct directories
- Extensions are further organized into common utilities and built-in extensions
- Examples include minimal and advanced examples, as well as templates
- Tools include development utilities for extension creation

## Challenges

- No significant challenges encountered during task creation

## Next Steps

1. Create the directory structure as outlined in the TASK.md file
2. Set up basic Cargo.toml files for each new directory
3. Update workspace configuration to include the new crates
4. Create README.md files explaining the purpose of each directory
5. Document extension structure and conventions

## Notes

The existing `hello-world` crate is temporary and should eventually be migrated to the new structure, likely as `examples/minimal`. This migration should be documented as part of this task.
