# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

Initial CI workflow implementation completed. Created GitHub Actions workflow for building CLI across platforms and WebAssembly extensions.

## Completed Work

- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
  - Multi-platform CLI builds (macOS ARM64/x86_64, Linux x86_64)
  - Extension builds using Makefile (identity, ledger)
  - Artifact collection and release process
  - Checksum generation

## Technical Details

- CLI Build Strategy:

  - Uses matrix strategy for platform-specific builds
  - Targets: aarch64-apple-darwin, x86_64-apple-darwin, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  - Builds with --release flag

- Extension Builds:

  - Uses project Makefile with CARGO_RELEASE=1
  - Builds both identity and ledger extensions
  - Outputs WebAssembly component files

- Release Process:
  - Triggered on push to main
  - Creates GitHub release with version from icp-cli crate
  - Includes checksums for all artifacts
  - Combines CLI binaries and extension components

## Next Steps

- Test the workflow with a push to main
- Consider adding:
  - Testing strategy
  - Code quality checks
  - Documentation verification

## Notes

The workflow combines patterns from existing CI examples while simplifying the extension build process through direct Makefile usage.
