# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-003

## Current State

Added wasm-tools installation to fix extension component builds.

## Completed Work

- Added wasm-tools installation step to build-extensions job
- Placed it after target setup but before extension builds

## Technical Details

- Uses `cargo install wasm-tools` to install the required tool
- This tool is needed by the Makefile's component target which uses `wasm-tools component new`

## Next Steps

- Test the workflow with a push to main to verify extension component builds succeed

## Notes

This addresses the wasm-tools dependency required by the Makefile for creating WebAssembly components.
