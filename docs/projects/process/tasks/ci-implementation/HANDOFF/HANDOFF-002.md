# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-002

## Current State

Fixed extension build configuration by adding required WebAssembly target.

## Completed Work

- Added wasm32-unknown-unknown target setup step to extension build job
- Committed fix with appropriate message

## Technical Details

- Added `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` before extension builds
- This ensures the required target is available for WebAssembly compilation

## Next Steps

- Test the workflow with a push to main to verify extension builds succeed

## Notes

This addresses the initial build failure where the WebAssembly target was missing for extension compilation.
