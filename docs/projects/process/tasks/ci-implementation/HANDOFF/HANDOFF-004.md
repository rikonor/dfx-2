# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-004

## Current State

Fixed CLI binary artifact paths to match actual binary name.

## Completed Work

- Updated artifact paths to use 'icp' instead of 'icp-cli'
  - In build-cli job's artifact upload
  - In release job's artifact preparation

## Technical Details

- Changed paths to match the binary name defined in icp-cli's Cargo.toml:
  ```toml
  [[bin]]
  name = "icp"
  path = "src/main.rs"
  ```

## Next Steps

- Test the workflow with a push to main to verify artifact collection succeeds

## Notes

This addresses the artifact collection failure where the workflow was looking for 'icp-cli' but the binary is actually named 'icp'.
