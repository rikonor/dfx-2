# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-005

## Current State

New workflow structure implemented with skeleton implementations, ready for testing.

## Completed Work

- Archived existing workflows for reference (ci.yml and deploy-scripts.yml)
- Created new workflow structure:
  - test.yml with path-based filtering
  - release.yml with package variants
  - Distribution workflow skeletons (homebrew.yml, apt.yml, scripts.yml)
- Added validation and placeholder operations in all workflows

## Technical Details

- test.yml:

  - Filters on crates/**, Cargo.\*, .github/workflows/**, Makefile
  - Matrix testing across platforms
  - Mock test results and artifact generation

- release.yml:

  - Manual trigger with version input
  - Matrix build including package-specific variants
  - Mock binary and extension generation
  - Draft release creation
  - Distribution workflow triggers

- Distribution workflows:
  - Separate workflows for each distribution method
  - Mock operations for testing structure
  - Placeholder file generation
  - GitHub Pages deployment simulation

## Challenges

- Balancing separation of concerns vs workflow consolidation
- Handling package-specific build requirements
- Ensuring proper workflow triggering sequence
- Maintaining testability with mock operations

## Next Steps

- Test workflows by:
  1. Push to a branch to verify test.yml triggers and filtering
  2. Try manual release workflow to verify:
     - Build matrix works
     - Release creation
     - Distribution workflow triggering
  3. Verify distribution workflows execute correctly
- Begin implementing actual operations once structure is verified
- Consider matrix approach for distribution workflows if current structure proves unwieldy

## Notes

The new structure provides a clean separation of concerns while maintaining the ability to test the overall workflow without implementing actual operations. The mock operations make it easy to verify the structure works before adding complexity with real implementations.
