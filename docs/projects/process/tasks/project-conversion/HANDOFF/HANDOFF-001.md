# Project Conversion Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

- Task structure and documentation created
- Initial analysis of existing projects completed
- Tasks identified and categorized

## Key Findings

### Extension IPC Project Analysis

- Located in `docs/projects/extension-ipc/`
- Completed project with comprehensive documentation
- Clean separation of features (communication, dependency management, infrastructure)
- Well-documented completion status in COMPLETION.md

### Core Extraction Project Analysis

- Located in `docs/projects/core-extraction/`
- Active project with detailed progress tracking
- Clear stage-based organization
- Extensive documentation in PROJECT_STATUS.md

## Implementation Guide

### Suggested Approach

1. **Start with Completed Project First**

   - Begin with extension-ipc project
   - Its completion provides clear task boundaries
   - Use COMPLETION.md as primary reference
   - Natural separation into 3 main tasks

2. **Core Extraction Project Migration**

   - Use stage-based separation from PROJECT_STATUS.md
   - Consider active tasks carefully
   - Preserve work-in-progress status
   - Maintain ongoing task context

3. **Task Naming Convention**
   ```
   tasks/
   ├── ext-ipc-communication/     # From Extension IPC
   ├── ext-ipc-dependency/        # From Extension IPC
   ├── ext-ipc-infrastructure/    # From Extension IPC
   ├── core-setup/               # From Core Extraction
   ├── core-interface-migration/ # From Core Extraction
   └── core-testing/            # From Core Extraction
   ```

### Task Creation Process

1. For each task:

   ```
   tasks/task-name/
   ├── TASK.md
   └── HANDOFF/
   ```

2. TASK.md Template:

   ```markdown
   # Task Name

   ## Overview

   [Brief description]

   ## Context

   [Original project context]

   ## Scope

   - Feature 1
   - Feature 2

   ## Status

   - Current Phase: [phase]
   - Progress: [x%]
   - Last Updated: [date]

   ## Implementation Details

   ```

## Key Files to Reference

### Extension IPC Project

1. `docs/projects/extension-ipc/COMPLETION.md`

   - Contains final feature list
   - Implementation details
   - Success criteria

2. `docs/projects/extension-ipc/PLAN.md`

   - Original project goals
   - Architectural decisions

3. Session handoffs (0-7)
   - Chronological progress
   - Technical decisions
   - Implementation challenges

### Core Extraction Project

1. `docs/projects/core-extraction/PROJECT_STATUS.md`

   - Current progress (45% overall)
   - Stage-by-stage breakdown
   - Active work items

2. Session handoffs (1-9)
   - Detailed progress tracking
   - Technical challenges
   - Implementation notes

## Important Considerations

1. **Dependency Handling**

   - Some tasks depend on others
   - Document dependencies in each TASK.md
   - Maintain chronological context

2. **Status Preservation**

   - Transfer completion percentages accurately
   - Preserve work-in-progress markers
   - Maintain task priorities

3. **Documentation Migration**

   - Copy relevant sections from original docs
   - Update file references
   - Preserve technical context

4. **Handoff Notes**
   - Review all session handoffs
   - Extract task-specific information
   - Create initial handoff doc for each task

## Migration Checklist

1. [ ] Create core task directories
2. [ ] Migrate Extension IPC tasks
3. [ ] Migrate Core Extraction tasks
4. [ ] Update all cross-references
5. [ ] Verify task dependencies
6. [ ] Review documentation completeness
7. [ ] Remove old project structure

## Technical Tips

1. **File Operations**

   - Use `replace_in_file` for targeted updates
   - Create new files with `write_to_file`
   - Preserve file permissions

2. **Content Migration**
   - Extract relevant sections
   - Update relative paths
   - Maintain formatting
   - Preserve code blocks

## Success Validation

Before completing each task migration:

1. Verify all technical details preserved
2. Check cross-references
3. Validate dependencies
4. Ensure status accuracy
5. Test documentation links

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Extension IPC task migration
2. Create task structure for completed features
3. Move to Core Extraction tasks
4. Update PROJECT.md with new task list
5. Remove old project structure

## Questions to Address

1. Should we maintain any original files for reference?
2. How to handle partial task completion?
3. Should we create separate tasks for planned work?

## Final Notes

The goal is to preserve all technical and historical context while improving organization. Take an iterative approach, completing one task migration fully before moving to the next. Document any decisions or challenges in the task handoffs.
