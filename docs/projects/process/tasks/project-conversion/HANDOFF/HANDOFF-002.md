# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-002

## Current State

The Project Conversion task is in progress. The Extension IPC project has been successfully converted to the new task-based structure, while the Core Extraction project conversion is pending.

## Completed Work

- Created task-based structure for the Extension IPC project:
  - Created three task directories: communication, dependency, and infrastructure
  - Created TASK.md files for each task with comprehensive documentation
  - Created initial handoff documents for each task
  - Updated PROJECT.md to reflect the new task-based structure

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

The conversion was implemented following these steps:

1. **Directory Structure Setup**: Created task directories under the extension-ipc project
2. **Task Documentation Creation**: Created TASK.md files for each task
3. **Content Migration**: Extracted relevant content from the original project documentation
4. **Handoff Documentation**: Created initial handoff documents for each task
5. **Project Status Update**: Created a PROJECT.md file for the extension-ipc project

### Key Decisions

- **Task Organization**: Divided the Extension IPC project into three distinct tasks based on the original project's feature breakdown:

  - Cross-Extension Communication
  - Dependency Management
  - Core Infrastructure

- **Documentation Preservation**: Maintained references to the original project documentation for historical context

## Challenges

- **Content Organization**: Determining the appropriate content to include in each task's documentation required careful analysis of the original project documentation
- **Dependency Tracking**: Ensuring that dependencies between tasks were correctly documented

## Next Steps

1. **Core Extraction Project Conversion**:

   - Create task-based structure for the Core Extraction project
   - Create TASK.md files for each identified task
   - Create initial handoff documents for each task
   - Update PROJECT.md to reflect the new task-based structure

2. **Verification and Validation**:

   - Verify all technical details are preserved during migration
   - Validate that dependencies are correctly documented
   - Confirm status accuracy for each task

3. **Final Documentation**:
   - Create a final handoff document once all projects are converted
   - Document any remaining challenges or considerations

## Notes

The Extension IPC project conversion provides a good template for the Core Extraction project conversion. The same approach can be applied, with adjustments for the different status (Core Extraction is still in progress) and the different task breakdown.
