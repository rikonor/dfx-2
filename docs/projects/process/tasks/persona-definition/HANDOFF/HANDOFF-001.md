# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

Completed initial persona definitions and documentation structure. All core personas are defined with clear responsibilities and concrete verification steps.

## Completed Work

- Created core persona guidelines:
  - QA_TESTER.md: Testing and quality verification
  - PROJECT_MANAGER.md: Progress coordination
  - IMPLEMENTER.md: Bounded implementation
  - ARCHITECT.md: Technical decisions
  - CONCEPT_PROVER.md: Approach validation
- Added personas/README.md with principles and patterns
- Updated GUIDELINES.md with role-based development section
- Established clear scope boundaries between roles

## Technical Details

- Defined concrete verification steps for each role
- Created explicit process for scope changes
- Established role-specific session requirements
- Added role selection to session startup process

## Next Steps

1. Resume Homebrew package task as IMPLEMENTER

   - Follow Distribution Framework Implementation subtask
   - Respect scope boundaries per IMPLEMENTER.md
   - Elevate any scope questions to ARCHITECT

2. Future persona refinements:
   - Monitor effectiveness of scope boundaries
   - Gather feedback on role interactions
   - Document emerging patterns
   - Consider additional personas as needed

## Notes

The Homebrew task will be a good first test of our role-based approach, particularly the scope management between IMPLEMENTER and ARCHITECT roles. Pay special attention to how the scope boundaries work in practice.

## Guidelines Audit

Guidelines followed in this session:

- [Documentation Standards] Clear Structure

  - Created consistent format across all persona files
  - Used concrete, verifiable requirements
  - Maintained clear section organization

- [Project Organization] Role Definition
  - Established clear responsibilities
  - Defined interaction patterns
  - Created explicit processes

Guidelines that could have been better applied:

- [Project Creation] Initial Templates
  - Started with a template approach before realizing organic growth was better
  - Learned to let structure emerge from needs

New guideline suggestions:

- Consider adding "Role Selection" section to task documentation
- Add explicit "Scope Management" section to relevant guidelines
- Document role interaction patterns as they emerge
