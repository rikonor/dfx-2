# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-002

## Current State

The Core Interface Types Migration task is making good progress. The interface detection implementation in icp-core has been restored to use the proper wasmtime API for component inspection, rather than the simplified version that was previously in place.

## Completed Work

- Restored the proper interface detection implementation in icp-core
- Updated test-utils to depend on icp-core directly
- Verified that icp-core tests pass with the restored implementation
- Identified issues with test-utils tests that need to be addressed

## Technical Details

### Interface Detection Implementation

Discovered that there was a previously working implementation of interface detection using the wasmtime API. Restored this implementation in icp-core, which properly inspects component interfaces using `component.component_type()` and iterating through imports and exports.

### Test-Utils Dependencies

Updated the test-utils crate to depend directly on icp-core, rather than just on icp-cli. This allows the tests to import the interface types directly from icp-core.

### Documentation Updates

Updated the project documentation to reflect the current state of the project, correcting the misconception that the wasmtime API doesn't provide methods for inspecting component interfaces.

## Challenges

- **Misconception About Wasmtime API**: There was a misconception in the previous documentation that the wasmtime API doesn't provide straightforward methods for inspecting component interfaces. Discovered that this was not the case, and that there was a working implementation that was lost during the migration. Restored this implementation.

- **Test-Utils Dependencies**: The test-utils crate was not directly depending on icp-core, which caused issues when trying to use the interface types from icp-core. Added icp-core as a direct dependency to resolve this issue.

- **Test Failures**: Some test-utils tests are still failing. These will need to be addressed by reviewing and updating the test templates to work with the current implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Fix failing test-utils tests by reviewing and updating the test templates
2. Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
3. Refine error handling for interface detection
4. Begin planning for the Component and Extension Logic Migration task:
   - Identify which components and extension logic need to be moved
   - Plan the migration strategy to minimize disruption
   - Update the extension.rs file to use the new icp-core types

## Notes

The task is progressing well, with approximately 75% of the work completed. The next steps should focus on fixing the failing tests and preparing for the Component and Extension Logic Migration task.
