# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-003

## Current State

The Core Interface Types Migration task is in progress. We have completed the documentation improvement task from the previous session. The WebAssembly Component Model Explainer document has been successfully split into smaller, more focused files for easier reference.

## Completed Work

- Successfully split the Explainer.md document into smaller, more manageable files as planned:
  - explainer-overview.md: Introduction, gated features, and high-level concepts
  - explainer-grammar.md: Core grammar definitions
  - explainer-component-definitions.md: Component and instance definitions
  - explainer-type-system.md: Type definitions, type checking, and the type system
  - explainer-canonical-abi.md: Canonical definitions and ABI
  - explainer-values-and-imports.md: Value definitions, start definitions, imports/exports
  - explainer-js-embedding.md: JavaScript embedding and ESM integration
  - explainer-examples.md: Examples and use cases
- Verified that all files contain the correct content from the original Explainer.md
- Confirmed that the README.md in the explainer directory already references all these files

## Technical Details

### Documentation Organization

Maintained a consistent structure for each split file, including:

- A clear title and introduction
- The relevant content from the original Explainer.md
- A References section at the end with relevant links

### Content Preservation

Ensured that all content from the original Explainer.md was preserved in the split files, maintaining the original structure and formatting.

## Challenges

- **Content Extraction**: Extracting the correct sections from the original Explainer.md required careful attention to ensure that all content was preserved and properly organized.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the WAT templates in test-utils to use the correct syntax for component exports
2. Update the failing tests to work with the corrected templates
3. Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
4. Refine error handling for interface detection
5. Begin planning for the Component and Extension Logic Migration task:
   - Identify which components and extension logic need to be moved
   - Plan the migration strategy to minimize disruption

## Notes

The split Explainer documentation will serve as a valuable reference for understanding the WAT syntax and component model concepts, which will be essential for fixing the test templates and implementing proper interface detection.
