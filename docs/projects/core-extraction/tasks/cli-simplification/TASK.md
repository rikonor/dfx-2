# CLI Simplification Task

## Overview

Refactor dfx-cli to be a thin wrapper around dfx-core, ensuring that the CLI-specific code is properly separated from the core functionality.

## Scope

- Refactor command handling
- Update main.rs to use dfx-core APIs
- Clean up CLI-specific code
- Improve error handling

## Status

- Current Phase: Not Started
- Progress: 0%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-17

## Implementation Details

This task has not yet been started. The implementation will involve:

### Command Handling Refactoring

- Refactor command handling to use dfx-core APIs
- Create clean abstractions for command operations
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing CLI behavior

### Main.rs Updates

- Update main.rs to use dfx-core APIs
- Simplify the main entry point
- Improve error handling and reporting

### CLI-Specific Code Cleanup

- Identify and clean up CLI-specific code
- Move any remaining core functionality to dfx-core
- Ensure proper separation of concerns

### Error Handling Improvements

- Improve error handling and reporting
- Create consistent error patterns
- Enhance user-facing error messages

## Dependencies

- Setup and Initial Structure Task: Required for the dfx-core crate to exist
- Core Interface Types Migration Task: Required for interface detection functionality
- Component and Extension Logic Migration Task: Required for component and extension management

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

As this task has not yet been started, specific challenges and solutions have not been identified. However, anticipated challenges include:

- Maintaining backward compatibility while refactoring
- Ensuring proper abstraction boundaries
- Handling complex command interactions
- Improving error reporting without breaking existing workflows

## Success Criteria

- All CLI commands work as before
- Reduced code size in dfx-cli
- Clear separation between CLI and core logic
- End-to-end tests pass

## Notes

This task is part of the Core Extraction project, which aims to split dfx-cli into separate core library and CLI components to improve maintainability, testability, and potential reusability.

The implementation of this task will build upon the work done in the previous tasks, leveraging the functionality that has been moved to dfx-core.
