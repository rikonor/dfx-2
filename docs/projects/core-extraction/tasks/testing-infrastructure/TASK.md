# Testing Infrastructure Task

## Overview

Improve overall test coverage and testing tools for the icp-core crate, ensuring that the functionality is properly tested and documented.

## Scope

- Update test-utils to use icp-core
- Add more comprehensive integration tests
- Add benchmarks for core operations
- Add documentation tests
- Implement WAT validation testing utility

## Status

- Current Phase: In Progress
- Progress: 5%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-17

## Implementation Details

### Test-Utils Updates

- Update test-utils to use icp-core APIs
- Improve WAT templates with proper component model syntax
- Add detailed documentation to all WAT templates

### WAT Validation Testing Utility

- Implement a utility for validating WAT code
- Create test cases for various WAT scenarios
- Add integration tests for the validation utility

### Comprehensive Testing

- Add more comprehensive tests for core functionality
- Create benchmarks for core operations
- Add documentation tests with examples

## Dependencies

- Setup and Initial Structure Task: Required for the icp-core crate to exist
- Core Interface Types Migration Task: Required for interface detection functionality

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Template Documentation Structure

Implemented a standardized documentation format for each template, including sections for Purpose, Structure, Key Features, Common Issues, and Test Expectations, making it easier for developers to understand and modify templates.

### WAT Template Issues

Fixed various issues with the WebAssembly Component Model templates:

- Parameter type mismatches in string handling functions
- Return type mismatches in string return functions
- Boolean conversion issues for boolean return values
- Duplicate interface naming issues
- Log function return type issues in nested instances template

Some functions still have mismatches between their signatures and the canonical ABI requirements, which need to be identified and fixed.

## Success Criteria

- Test coverage above 80% for icp-core
- All test utilities use icp-core APIs
- Documentation includes examples
- Performance benchmarks established

## Remaining Work

- Implement the WAT validation testing utility
- Create test cases for various WAT scenarios
- Add integration tests for the validation utility
- Add more comprehensive tests for core functionality
- Create benchmarks for core operations
- Add documentation tests with examples

## Notes

This task is part of the Core Extraction project, which aims to split icp-cli into separate core library and CLI components to improve maintainability, testability, and potential reusability.

The implementation of this task is being done in parallel with the Core Interface Types Migration task, as improvements to the testing infrastructure help ensure the quality of the migrated code.
