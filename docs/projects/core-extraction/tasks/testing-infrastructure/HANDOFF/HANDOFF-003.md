# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-003

## Current State

The Testing Infrastructure task is making good progress. The WAT templates have been thoroughly documented and their issues fixed. The next major task will be implementing a testing utility for validating WAT code.

## Completed Work

- Added detailed documentation to all WAT templates in templates.rs:

  - Added purpose descriptions for each template
  - Documented structure and key components
  - Listed key WebAssembly Component Model features demonstrated
  - Highlighted common issues and pitfalls
  - Added test expectations for each template

- Fixed and improved template issues:
  - Fixed log function return type in nested instances template
  - Fixed duplicate interface names in DUPLICATE_INTERFACE_TEMPLATE
  - Enhanced error documentation in all templates
  - Made template comments more consistent and comprehensive

## Technical Details

### Template Documentation Structure

Each template now has a standardized documentation format:

- Includes sections for Purpose, Structure, Key Features, Common Issues, and Test Expectations
- Makes it easier for developers to understand and modify templates

### Testing Utility Planning

- Need to implement a utility for validating WAT code
- Will build upon existing test infrastructure
- Should integrate with the current testing framework

### Project Stage Priorities

- Moving forward with the Testing Infrastructure task in parallel with the Core Interface Types Migration task
- This will help ensure better quality as we proceed with later stages

## Challenges

- **Documentation Consistency**: Ensured all templates follow the same documentation structure for better maintainability
- **Error Documentation**: Enhanced error-related comments to help developers understand and fix issues
- **Template Organization**: Improved organization of template code with clear section markers and explanatory comments

## Next Steps

1. Set up WAT validation testing utility:

   - Implement the validation script (to be provided in next session)
   - Create test cases for various WAT scenarios
   - Add integration tests for the validation utility

2. Complete remaining Core Interface Types Migration tasks:

   - Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
   - Finalize error handling for interface detection

3. Continue Testing Infrastructure tasks:
   - Improve test coverage for core functionality
   - Add more test utilities as needed
   - Create benchmarks for core operations

## Notes

The next session will focus on implementing the WAT validation testing utility. The user has a script ready that we'll integrate into our testing infrastructure.
