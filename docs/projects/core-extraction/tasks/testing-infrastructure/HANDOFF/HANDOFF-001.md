# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

The Testing Infrastructure task is in progress. We've identified specific issues with the test-utils tests that were failing in the previous session. The interface detection implementation in dfx-core is working correctly, but the test templates need to be updated to match the correct WAT syntax for component exports.

## Completed Work

- Analyzed the failing tests in test-utils and identified the issue with WAT templates
- Discovered that the WAT templates have syntax errors in the export statements
- Identified the need for a WebAssembly Component Model reference document
- Created a plan to split the large Explainer.md into smaller, more manageable files
- Developed a strategy for fixing the failing tests

## Technical Details

### WAT Template Fixes

Identified that the test templates have syntax errors in the export statements. The error "unexpected token expected an index or an identifier" occurs at the export lines in our templates, indicating incorrect nesting of parentheses or other syntax issues.

### Documentation Organization

Decided to split the large Explainer.md into smaller, more manageable files to make it easier to reference specific parts of the documentation when needed. This will help with future development and debugging.

## Challenges

- **WAT Syntax Complexity**: The WebAssembly Component Model introduces complex syntax for component definitions, especially for exports and imports. Decided to keep a reference document in the repository to help with this complexity.

- **Test Template Issues**: The test templates were written with incorrect WAT syntax. Identified the specific issues and have a plan to fix them in the next session.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the WAT templates in test-utils to use the correct syntax for component exports
2. Update the failing tests to work with the corrected templates
3. Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Split the Explainer.md into the following smaller files:
     - explainer-overview.md: Introduction, gated features, and high-level concepts
     - explainer-grammar.md: Core grammar definitions
     - explainer-component-definitions.md: Component and instance definitions
     - explainer-type-system.md: Type definitions, type checking, and the type system
     - explainer-canonical-abi.md: Canonical definitions and ABI
     - explainer-values-and-imports.md: Value definitions, start definitions, imports/exports
     - explainer-js-embedding.md: JavaScript embedding and ESM integration
     - explainer-examples.md: Examples and use cases

## Notes

The WebAssembly Component Model Explainer document will be a valuable resource for understanding the correct syntax for WAT templates and component model concepts. By fixing the test templates and adding more comprehensive tests, we'll ensure that the interface detection functionality works correctly and is well-tested.
