# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-002

## Current State

The Testing Infrastructure task is making good progress. We have successfully fixed the WAT templates in test-utils that were causing test failures. All tests are now passing, which completes a significant portion of the testing infrastructure improvements.

## Completed Work

- Fixed WAT templates in test-utils to use proper WebAssembly Component Model syntax:
  - Updated instance export patterns to properly define instances before exporting them
  - Added realloc function and memory handling support to all core modules
  - Corrected memory reference syntax in canon lift operations
  - Updated function names to use kebab-case format for WebAssembly Component Model compatibility
- Updated test assertions to match the template changes
- Verified all tests are now passing

## Technical Details

### Instance Export Pattern

Implemented a two-step export pattern where we first define a named instance with its exports, then export that instance with a namespace. This follows the Component Model's design for proper encapsulation.

### Memory and Realloc Handling

Added a realloc function to all core modules with a simple dummy implementation for testing purposes. This is required by the Canonical ABI for string handling.

### Memory Reference Syntax

Corrected the memory reference syntax in canon lift operations to use `(memory $instance "mem")` instead of the incorrect `(memory (core memory $instance "mem"))`.

### Kebab-Case Naming

Updated function names to use kebab-case (e.g., "number-to-string" instead of "number_to_string") to comply with the WebAssembly Component Model naming conventions.

## Challenges

- **Canonical ABI Requirements**: The error "canonical option 'memory' is required" indicated that we needed to specify memory options in the canon lift operations. Resolved this by adding the proper memory and realloc options.

- **Memory Reference Syntax**: The error "unexpected token expected an index or an identifier" pointed to incorrect syntax in our memory references. Fixed this by using the correct syntax based on the reference example.

- **Naming Conventions**: The error "export name is not a valid extern name" revealed that the Component Model requires kebab-case for export names. Updated all function names to follow this convention.

## Next Steps

1. Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
2. Refine error handling for interface detection
3. Begin planning for the Component and Extension Logic Migration task:
   - Identify which components and extension logic need to be moved to dfx-core
   - Plan the migration strategy to minimize disruption
   - Create a detailed task list for implementation

## Notes

The WebAssembly Component Model documentation, particularly the explainer documents we split in a previous session, proved invaluable for understanding the correct syntax and requirements. The reference to a known valid WAT example was especially helpful in identifying the proper patterns to follow.
