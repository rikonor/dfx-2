# Component and Extension Logic Migration Task

## Overview

Move core component and extension handling logic to dfx-core, ensuring that the component instantiation and extension management capabilities are properly extracted from dfx-cli.

## Scope

- Move component handling logic
- Move extension management
- Move dependency graph logic
- Create proper abstraction layers

## Status

- Current Phase: Not Started
- Progress: 0%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-17

## Implementation Details

This task has not yet been started. The implementation will involve:

### Component Handling Logic

- Move component instantiation and management code to dfx-core
- Create clean abstractions for component operations
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

### Extension Management

- Move extension registration and discovery logic
- Move extension loading and initialization code
- Create proper abstractions for extension lifecycle management

### Dependency Graph Logic

- Move dependency resolution code
- Create clean abstractions for dependency management
- Ensure proper handling of circular dependencies

## Dependencies

- Setup and Initial Structure Task: Required for the dfx-core crate to exist
- Core Interface Types Migration Task: Required for interface detection functionality

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

As this task has not yet been started, specific challenges and solutions have not been identified. However, anticipated challenges include:

- Maintaining backward compatibility while refactoring
- Ensuring proper abstraction boundaries
- Handling complex dependency relationships
- Managing state across component and extension operations

## Success Criteria

- Extension management commands work
- Dependency resolution works
- Component instantiation works
- Added unit tests for each migrated module
- Integration tests verify extension lifecycle

## Notes

This task is part of the Core Extraction project, which aims to split dfx-cli into separate core library and CLI components to improve maintainability, testability, and potential reusability.

The implementation of this task will build upon the work done in the Core Interface Types Migration task, leveraging the interface detection functionality that has been moved to dfx-core.
