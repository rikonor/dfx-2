# Component and Extension Logic Migration Task

## Overview

Move core component and extension handling logic to icp-core while recovering and properly integrating implementation details from previous versions. This task combines the migration of component/extension management with the recovery of critical functionality from commit 3744ac4.

## Scope

### Implementation Recovery

- Recover and properly distribute core runtime functionality
- Integrate function registry system with new architecture
- Restore and enhance dynamic linking capabilities
- Preserve extension management functionality

### Core Migration

- Move component handling logic to icp-core
- Move extension management to icp-core
- Move dependency graph logic to icp-core
- Create proper abstraction layers
- Ensure clean separation of concerns

## Status

- Current Phase: Planning
- Progress: 0%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-18

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Implementation Recovery & Analysis

#### Core Runtime Recovery

1. Function Registry System

   - Integrate existing function registry with new architecture
   - Enhance function reference management between extensions
   - Improve extension interoperability

2. Dynamic Linking System

   - Enhance import linking for extensions
   - Improve export resolution
   - Optimize function reference management
   - Integrate with new component model

3. Extension Management
   - Improve extension addition/removal
   - Integrate with moved interface detection
   - Enhance manifest handling
   - Optimize precompilation and storage

### Phase 2: Core Component Migration

#### Component Management Layer

- Move to icp-core:
  - Component instantiation
  - Component precompilation
  - Component serialization/deserialization
  - State management

#### Extension System Migration

- Move to icp-core:
  - Extension registration
  - Extension discovery
  - Extension loading/unloading
  - Extension state management

#### Dependency Management

- Move to icp-core:
  - Dependency graph construction
  - Dependency validation
  - Circular dependency detection
  - Version compatibility checking

### Phase 3: CLI Layer Refinement

#### CLI Interface

- Create clean CLI abstractions
- Implement command handlers
- Error handling and reporting
- Progress indication

#### State Management

- Extension state tracking
- Component lifecycle management
- Resource cleanup

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing

#### Integration Testing

- Component instantiation
- Extension lifecycle
- Dependency resolution
- Error handling
- Resource management

#### Unit Testing

- Component management
- Extension system
- Dependency resolution
- Function registry
- Dynamic linking

## Dependencies

- Setup and Initial Structure Task: Required for the icp-core crate to exist
- Core Interface Types Migration Task: Required for interface detection functionality

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Implementation Recovery

- Challenge: Maintaining functionality while restructuring
- Solution: Careful phasing of changes, comprehensive testing

### Architecture Boundaries

- Challenge: Determining proper abstraction boundaries
- Solution: Clear interface definitions, minimal coupling

### State Management

- Challenge: Managing complex state across components
- Solution: Centralized state management in icp-core

### Testing Coverage

- Challenge: Ensuring comprehensive test coverage
- Solution: Systematic testing strategy, both unit and integration

## Success Criteria

### Functionality

- All features from commit 3744ac4 working
- Clean separation between core and CLI
- Proper error handling
- Resource management

### Architecture

- Clear abstraction boundaries
- Minimal coupling
- Proper state management
- Clean interfaces

### Testing

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Integration tests passing
- Performance benchmarks
- Resource leak checks

## Implementation Strategy

### Iterative Development

1. Small, focused changes
2. Regular testing
3. Continuous integration
4. Documentation updates

### Migration Process

1. Identify component to migrate
2. Move to icp-core
3. Create clean interface
4. Update CLI layer
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

## Notes

This task is part of the Core Extraction project, which aims to split icp-cli into separate core library and CLI components. The implementation will build upon the interface detection functionality in icp-core while recovering and properly integrating critical functionality from previous versions.

The focus is on maintaining functionality while improving the overall architecture and ensuring proper separation of concerns between icp-core and icp-cli.
