# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

The Component and Extension Logic Migration task has been updated with a comprehensive plan that combines:

1. Recovery of implementation details from commit 3744ac4
2. Migration of component and extension management to icp-core
3. Proper integration with the new architecture

## Completed Work

- Analyzed implementation details in commit 3744ac4
- Identified key functionality to recover:
  - Function Registry System
  - Dynamic Linking System
  - Extension Management
- Created detailed four-phase implementation plan
- Updated TASK.md with comprehensive implementation strategy

## Technical Details

### Key Implementation Components Found in 3744ac4

1. Function Registry (function_registry.rs):

   - Tracks function references between extensions
   - Manages reference registration and resolution
   - Provides key creation and status tracking

2. Dynamic Linker (dynamic_linker.rs):

   - Handles import linking for extensions
   - Manages export resolution
   - Integrates with function registry
   - Provides status tracking and debugging

3. Extension Management (extension.rs):
   - Handles extension addition/removal
   - Manages component precompilation
   - Integrates with interface detection
   - Handles dependency validation

### Architecture Decisions

1. State Management:

   - Core state management will be centralized in icp-core
   - CLI layer will maintain minimal state
   - Clear interfaces for state updates

2. Component Model Integration:
   - Proper separation between core and CLI concerns
   - Clean abstraction layers
   - Consistent error handling

## Challenges

1. Implementation Recovery:

   - Need to carefully preserve functionality while restructuring
   - Must maintain compatibility with existing extensions
   - Need to ensure proper error handling throughout

2. Architecture Boundaries:
   - Clear separation between icp-core and icp-cli
   - Proper abstraction layers
   - Minimal coupling

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1: Implementation Recovery

   - Set up core runtime components in icp-core
   - Migrate function registry system
   - Integrate with new architecture

2. Prepare for Component Migration

   - Create new module structure in icp-core
   - Define clear interfaces
   - Set up testing infrastructure

3. Documentation Updates
   - Document recovered implementation details
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Update API documentation

## Notes

The task has been expanded to include implementation recovery while maintaining the original goal of proper component and extension logic migration. The focus is on preserving functionality while improving the overall architecture.
