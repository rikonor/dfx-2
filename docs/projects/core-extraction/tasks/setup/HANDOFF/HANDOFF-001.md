# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

The Setup and Initial Structure task is nearly complete. The dfx-core crate has been created with a basic structure and minimal public API. The dfx-cli crate has been updated to use dfx-core for interface detection.

## Completed Work

- Created the dfx-core crate with a basic structure
- Updated workspace Cargo.toml to include dfx-core
- Set up initial module structure for dfx-core:
  - error.rs: Core error types
  - interface/: Interface detection and management
  - manifest/: Manifest handling
  - dependency/: Dependency resolution
- Created minimal public API in lib.rs
- Updated dfx-cli to use dfx-core for interface detection

## Technical Details

### Module Structure

The dfx-core crate has been organized into logical modules:

- error.rs: Core error types
- interface/: Interface detection and management
- manifest/: Manifest handling
- dependency/: Dependency resolution

### Minimal API

Started with a minimal public API that exposes only the essential types and functions needed by dfx-cli.

### Dependency Management

Updated dfx-cli to depend on dfx-core and modified the imports to use the new crate.

## Challenges

- **Import Resolution**: Had to carefully update imports in dfx-cli to use the new dfx-core crate. This required identifying all the places where the code was using the local modules and updating them to use the new crate.

- **Maintaining Compatibility**: Ensured that the existing functionality continued to work by keeping the same API structure in dfx-core as was in dfx-cli.

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for core functionality in dfx-core
2. Complete the task by ensuring all tests pass
3. Begin the Core Interface Types Migration task:
   - Move Interface/ComponentInterfaces to dfx-core
   - Move IfaceDetector trait and implementation
   - Update dfx-cli to use these from dfx-core
   - Add integration tests for interface detection

## Notes

The task is progressing well, with most of the work completed. The next steps should focus on adding tests and finalizing the setup before moving on to the Core Interface Types Migration task.
