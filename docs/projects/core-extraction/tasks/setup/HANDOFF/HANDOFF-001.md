# Task Handoff - HANDOFF-001

## Current State

The Setup and Initial Structure task is nearly complete. The icp-core crate has been created with a basic structure and minimal public API. The icp-cli crate has been updated to use icp-core for interface detection.

## Completed Work

- Created the icp-core crate with a basic structure
- Updated workspace Cargo.toml to include icp-core
- Set up initial module structure for icp-core:
  - error.rs: Core error types
  - interface/: Interface detection and management
  - manifest/: Manifest handling
  - dependency/: Dependency resolution
- Created minimal public API in lib.rs
- Updated icp-cli to use icp-core for interface detection

## Technical Details

### Module Structure

The icp-core crate has been organized into logical modules:

- error.rs: Core error types
- interface/: Interface detection and management
- manifest/: Manifest handling
- dependency/: Dependency resolution

### Minimal API

Started with a minimal public API that exposes only the essential types and functions needed by icp-cli.

### Dependency Management

Updated icp-cli to depend on icp-core and modified the imports to use the new crate.

## Challenges

- **Import Resolution**: Had to carefully update imports in icp-cli to use the new icp-core crate. This required identifying all the places where the code was using the local modules and updating them to use the new crate.

- **Maintaining Compatibility**: Ensured that the existing functionality continued to work by keeping the same API structure in icp-core as was in icp-cli.

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for core functionality in icp-core
2. Complete the task by ensuring all tests pass
3. Begin the Core Interface Types Migration task:
   - Move Interface/ComponentInterfaces to icp-core
   - Move IfaceDetector trait and implementation
   - Update icp-cli to use these from icp-core
   - Add integration tests for interface detection

## Notes

The task is progressing well, with most of the work completed. The next steps should focus on adding tests and finalizing the setup before moving on to the Core Interface Types Migration task.
