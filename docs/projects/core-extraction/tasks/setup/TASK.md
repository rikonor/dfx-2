# Setup and Initial Structure Task

## Overview

Create new dfx-core crate with minimal structure without breaking existing functionality, establishing the foundation for the Core Extraction project.

## Scope

- Create dfx-core crate
- Update workspace Cargo.toml
- Set up initial module structure
- Create minimal public API
- Add unit tests for core functionality

## Status

- Current Phase: Complete
- Progress: 100%
- Last Updated: 2025-03-17

## Implementation Details

### Crate Creation and Workspace Configuration

- Created new dfx-core crate in the workspace
- Updated workspace Cargo.toml to include the new crate
- Set up appropriate dependencies and feature flags
- Ensured build system correctly handles the new crate

### Module Structure Setup

- Established initial module structure for dfx-core
- Created minimal public API surface
- Set up documentation structure
- Implemented basic error handling

### Testing Infrastructure

- Added unit tests for core functionality
- Ensured all tests pass with the new structure
- Maintained compatibility with existing code

## Dependencies

- None (this was the initial task for the Core Extraction project)

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Maintaining Compatibility

Ensured that the creation of the new crate did not break existing functionality by carefully managing dependencies and maintaining backward compatibility with the existing code.

### Module Organization

Designed a clean and extensible module structure that would support future migration of functionality from dfx-cli to dfx-core.

## Success Criteria

- `cargo build` succeeds for all crates
- `cargo test` passes for existing tests
- dfx-core crate has version and documentation
- dfx-cli binary still functions normally

## Notes

This task was the first stage of the Core Extraction project, which aims to split dfx-cli into separate core library and CLI components to improve maintainability, testability, and potential reusability.
