# Core Extraction Project - Session 7 Handoff

## Completed in this Session

- Fixed WAT templates in test-utils to use proper WebAssembly Component Model syntax:
  - Updated instance export patterns to properly define instances before exporting them
  - Added realloc function and memory handling support to all core modules
  - Corrected memory reference syntax in canon lift operations
  - Updated function names to use kebab-case format for WebAssembly Component Model compatibility
- Updated test assertions to match the template changes
- Verified all tests are now passing
- Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md to reflect current progress

## Current State

We have successfully fixed the WAT templates in test-utils that were causing test failures. All tests are now passing, which completes a significant portion of Stage 2 (Core Interface Types Migration). The project is now at approximately 90% completion for Stage 2, with only the addition of more comprehensive tests and error handling refinement remaining.

The WebAssembly Component Model templates now correctly follow the proper syntax for:

1. Instance definition and export
2. Memory and realloc function handling
3. Canon lift operations with proper memory references
4. Kebab-case naming convention for exports

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Instance Export Pattern**: We implemented a two-step export pattern where we first define a named instance with its exports, then export that instance with a namespace. This follows the Component Model's design for proper encapsulation.

2. **Memory and Realloc Handling**: We added a realloc function to all core modules with a simple dummy implementation for testing purposes. This is required by the Canonical ABI for string handling.

3. **Memory Reference Syntax**: We corrected the memory reference syntax in canon lift operations to use `(memory $instance "mem")` instead of the incorrect `(memory (core memory $instance "mem"))`.

4. **Kebab-Case Naming**: We updated function names to use kebab-case (e.g., "number-to-string" instead of "number_to_string") to comply with the WebAssembly Component Model naming conventions.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Canonical ABI Requirements**: The error "canonical option 'memory' is required" indicated that we needed to specify memory options in the canon lift operations. We resolved this by adding the proper memory and realloc options.

- **Memory Reference Syntax**: The error "unexpected token expected an index or an identifier" pointed to incorrect syntax in our memory references. We fixed this by using the correct syntax based on the reference example.

- **Naming Conventions**: The error "export name is not a valid extern name" revealed that the Component Model requires kebab-case for export names. We updated all function names to follow this convention.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining tasks for Stage 2:

   - Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
   - Refine error handling for interface detection

2. Begin planning for Stage 3 (Component and Extension Logic Migration):
   - Identify which components and extension logic need to be moved to dfx-core
   - Plan the migration strategy to minimize disruption
   - Create a detailed task list for Stage 3 implementation

## Additional Notes

The WebAssembly Component Model documentation, particularly the explainer documents we split in the previous session, proved invaluable for understanding the correct syntax and requirements. The reference to a known valid WAT example was especially helpful in identifying the proper patterns to follow.

For the next session, please provide:

- Any insights on additional test cases that would be valuable for interface detection
- Feedback on the approach for Stage 3 migration planning
