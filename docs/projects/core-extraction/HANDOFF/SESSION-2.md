# Core Extraction Project - Session 2 Handoff

## Completed in this Session

- Added unit tests for core functionality in dfx-core:
  - Tests for Interface and ComponentInterfaces structs
  - Tests for IfaceDetector with custom components
  - Tests for Error types and error handling
- Fixed test issues with WAT templates by using simpler custom components
- Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md to mark Stage 1 as complete
- Verified that dfx-core tests pass successfully

## Current State

We have successfully completed Stage 1 (Setup and Initial Structure) of the core-extraction project. The dfx-core crate has a basic structure, minimal public API, and unit tests for core functionality.

The code compiles successfully with only some expected warnings. The unit tests for dfx-core pass, but there's an integration test in test-utils that fails because it's still using the private iface module from dfx-cli instead of the new interface module in dfx-core. This will be addressed in Stage 2.

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Test Structure**: We organized tests into logical groups:

   - Basic struct tests for Interface and ComponentInterfaces
   - Async tests for IfaceDetector using custom components
   - Error handling tests

2. **WAT Template Issues**: We encountered issues with the WAT templates in test-utils. Rather than modifying the templates (which would be a larger change), we created simpler custom components directly in our tests.

3. **Error Handling**: We updated the error tests to match the actual behavior of the Error enum.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Template Issues**: The MockComponentBuilder templates had syntax errors in the WAT format. We solved this by creating simpler custom components directly in our tests.

- **Async Testing**: We needed to set up async tests for the IfaceDetector. We added tokio as a dev-dependency and used the #[tokio::test] attribute for async tests.

- **Integration Test Failure**: The integration test in test-utils fails because it's using the private iface module from dfx-cli. This is expected as part of our migration and will be addressed in Stage 2.

## Next Steps

1. Begin Stage 2: Core Interface Types Migration

   - Update the integration test in test-utils to use dfx-core instead of dfx-cli
   - Implement actual interface detection in IfaceDetector (currently returns empty interfaces)
   - Make the iface module in dfx-cli public or remove it entirely
   - Add more comprehensive integration tests for interface detection

2. Continue with the remaining stages as outlined in the project plan

## Additional Notes

The project is progressing well, with Stage 1 now complete. The next session should focus on Stage 2, which involves migrating the core interface types to dfx-core and implementing actual interface detection.

For the next session, please provide:

- The updated PROJECT_STATUS.md file to see our progress
- Any feedback on the current implementation
- Guidance on what aspects of Stage 2 to prioritize
