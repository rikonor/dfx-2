# Core Extraction Project - Session 8 Handoff

## Completed in this Session

- Enhanced error handling in the interface detection module:

  - Added specific error types for interface detection in `error.rs`
  - Added tests for these error types
  - Updated documentation to explain error handling

- Added comprehensive documentation to the interface module:

  - Added detailed module documentation
  - Added examples of how to use the interface detection API
  - Added documentation for error handling

- Added more comprehensive tests for interface detection:

  - Created new test templates for edge cases (empty component, many interfaces, nested instances, duplicate interfaces)
  - Added tests for these templates
  - Added error handling tests (commented out for now)

- Started fixing WebAssembly Component Model template issues:
  - Fixed parameter type mismatch in `log_impl` function in NESTED_INSTANCES_TEMPLATE
  - Fixed return type mismatch in `number_to_string` function in MULTI_LIB_TEMPLATE
  - Added boolean conversion in MANY_INTERFACES_TEMPLATE

## Current State

We've made significant progress on Stage 2 (Core Interface Types Migration), but we're still encountering some issues with the WebAssembly Component Model templates. The tests are failing with the error:

```
lowered result types `[I32]` do not match result types `[I32 I32]` of core function 2 (at offset 0x191)
```

This suggests there's still a mismatch between the expected return type and the actual return type in one of the templates. We've made several fixes, but there are still some issues to resolve.

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Specific Error Types**: We added specific error types for interface detection to provide more detailed error messages and better error handling.

2. **Canonical ABI Handling**: We learned that the WebAssembly Component Model's canonical ABI has specific requirements:

   - String parameters: Core functions need two i32 parameters (pointer and length)
   - String returns: Core functions need to return two i32 values (pointer and length)
   - Boolean returns: Core functions need special handling with the `boolean-to-i32` option

3. **Documentation Approach**: We added comprehensive documentation to the interface module to make it easier for developers to understand how to use the interface detection API.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Parameter Type Mismatch**: We encountered an issue where the canonical ABI expected two parameters for string arguments, but our core function only accepted one. We fixed this by updating the function signature.

- **Return Type Mismatch**: We encountered an issue where the canonical ABI expected two return values for string returns, but our core function only returned one. We fixed this by updating the function signature.

- **Boolean Conversion**: We encountered an issue with boolean return values, which we attempted to fix by adding the `boolean-to-i32` option to the canon lift operation.

- **Remaining Issues**: We're still encountering issues with the templates, which will need to be addressed in the next session.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining issues with the WebAssembly Component Model templates:

   - Identify the specific function causing the error
   - Update the function signature to match the expected canonical ABI
   - Run the tests to verify the fix

2. Complete the remaining tasks for Stage 2:

   - Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
   - Refine error handling for interface detection

3. Begin planning for Stage 3:
   - Identify which components and extension logic need to be moved
   - Plan the migration strategy to minimize disruption

## Additional Notes

The WebAssembly Component Model's canonical ABI is quite complex and requires careful attention to function signatures. We've made good progress in understanding these requirements, but there are still some issues to resolve.

For the next session, it would be helpful to have a deeper understanding of the canonical ABI requirements for different types (strings, booleans, etc.) to ensure our templates are correct.
