# Core Extraction Project - Session 1 Handoff

## Completed in this Session

- Created the dfx-core crate with a basic structure
- Updated workspace Cargo.toml to include dfx-core
- Set up initial module structure for dfx-core:
  - error.rs: Core error types
  - interface/: Interface detection and management
  - manifest/: Manifest handling
  - dependency/: Dependency resolution
- Created minimal public API in lib.rs
- Updated dfx-cli to use dfx-core for interface detection
- Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md to reflect progress

## Current State

We have successfully completed most of Stage 1 (Setup and Initial Structure) of the core-extraction project. The dfx-core crate has been created with a basic structure and minimal public API. The dfx-cli crate has been updated to use dfx-core for interface detection.

The code compiles successfully, though there are some warnings that can be addressed in future sessions.

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Module Structure**: We organized the dfx-core crate into logical modules:

   - error.rs: Core error types
   - interface/: Interface detection and management
   - manifest/: Manifest handling
   - dependency/: Dependency resolution

2. **Minimal API**: We started with a minimal public API that exposes only the essential types and functions needed by dfx-cli.

3. **Dependency Management**: We updated dfx-cli to depend on dfx-core and modified the imports to use the new crate.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Import Resolution**: We had to carefully update imports in dfx-cli to use the new dfx-core crate. This required identifying all the places where the code was using the local modules and updating them to use the new crate.

- **Maintaining Compatibility**: We ensured that the existing functionality continued to work by keeping the same API structure in dfx-core as was in dfx-cli.

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for core functionality in dfx-core
2. Complete Stage 1 by ensuring all tests pass
3. Begin Stage 2: Core Interface Types Migration
   - Move Interface/ComponentInterfaces to dfx-core
   - Move IfaceDetector trait and implementation
   - Update dfx-cli to use these from dfx-core
   - Add integration tests for interface detection

## Additional Notes

The project is progressing well, with Stage 1 nearly complete. The next session should focus on adding tests and preparing for Stage 2, which involves migrating the core interface types to dfx-core.

For the next session, please provide:

- The updated PROJECT_STATUS.md file to see our progress
- Any feedback on the current implementation
- Guidance on what aspects of Stage 2 to prioritize
