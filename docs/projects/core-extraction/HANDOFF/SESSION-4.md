# Core Extraction Project - Session 4 Handoff

## Completed in this Session

- Restored the proper interface detection implementation in dfx-core
- Updated test-utils to depend on dfx-core directly
- Verified that dfx-core tests pass with the restored implementation
- Identified issues with test-utils tests that need to be addressed
- Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md to reflect current progress

## Current State

We have made significant progress on Stage 2 (Core Interface Types Migration) of the core-extraction project. The interface detection implementation in dfx-core has been restored to use the proper wasmtime API for component inspection, rather than the simplified version that was previously in place.

The dfx-core tests are now passing with the restored implementation, which confirms that the interface detection is working correctly. However, there are still issues with the test-utils tests that need to be addressed in the next session.

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Interface Detection Implementation**: We discovered that there was a previously working implementation of interface detection using the wasmtime API. We restored this implementation in dfx-core, which properly inspects component interfaces using `component.component_type()` and iterating through imports and exports.

2. **Test-Utils Dependencies**: We updated the test-utils crate to depend directly on dfx-core, rather than just on dfx-cli. This allows the tests to import the interface types directly from dfx-core.

3. **Documentation Updates**: We updated the project documentation to reflect the current state of the project, correcting the misconception that the wasmtime API doesn't provide methods for inspecting component interfaces.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Misconception About Wasmtime API**: There was a misconception in the previous documentation that the wasmtime API doesn't provide straightforward methods for inspecting component interfaces. We discovered that this was not the case, and that there was a working implementation that was lost during the migration. We restored this implementation.

- **Test-Utils Dependencies**: The test-utils crate was not directly depending on dfx-core, which caused issues when trying to use the interface types from dfx-core. We added dfx-core as a direct dependency to resolve this issue.

- **Test Failures**: Some test-utils tests are still failing. These will need to be addressed in the next session by reviewing and updating the test templates to work with the current implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Continue Stage 2: Core Interface Types Migration

   - Fix failing test-utils tests by reviewing and updating the test templates
   - Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
   - Refine error handling for interface detection

2. Begin planning for Stage 3: Component and Extension Logic Migration

   - Identify which components and extension logic need to be moved
   - Plan the migration strategy to minimize disruption
   - Update the extension.rs file to use the new dfx-core types

## Additional Notes

The project is progressing well, with Stage 2 now approximately 75% complete. The next session should focus on fixing the failing tests and preparing for Stage 3.

For the next session, please provide:

- Any insights on the failing test-utils tests and how they should be fixed
- Guidance on what aspects of Stage 2 to prioritize for completion
- Feedback on the approach for Stage 3 migration
