# Core Extraction Project - Session 6 Handoff

## Completed in this Session

- Successfully split the Explainer.md document into smaller, more manageable files as planned:
  - explainer-overview.md: Introduction, gated features, and high-level concepts
  - explainer-grammar.md: Core grammar definitions
  - explainer-component-definitions.md: Component and instance definitions
  - explainer-type-system.md: Type definitions, type checking, and the type system
  - explainer-canonical-abi.md: Canonical definitions and ABI
  - explainer-values-and-imports.md: Value definitions, start definitions, imports/exports
  - explainer-js-embedding.md: JavaScript embedding and ESM integration
  - explainer-examples.md: Examples and use cases
- Verified that all files contain the correct content from the original Explainer.md
- Confirmed that the README.md in the explainer directory already references all these files

## Current State

We have completed the documentation improvement task from the previous session. The WebAssembly Component Model Explainer document has been successfully split into smaller, more focused files for easier reference. This will make it easier for developers to find specific information about the Component Model without having to navigate through the entire document.

We are still in Stage 2 (Core Interface Types Migration) of the core-extraction project. The next focus should be on fixing the WAT templates in test-utils to use the correct syntax for component exports.

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Documentation Organization**: We decided to maintain a consistent structure for each split file, including:
   - A clear title and introduction
   - The relevant content from the original Explainer.md
   - A References section at the end with relevant links

2. **Content Preservation**: We ensured that all content from the original Explainer.md was preserved in the split files, maintaining the original structure and formatting.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Content Extraction**: Extracting the correct sections from the original Explainer.md required careful attention to ensure that all content was preserved and properly organized.

## Next Steps

1. Continue Stage 2: Core Interface Types Migration

   - Fix the WAT templates in test-utils to use the correct syntax for component exports
   - Update the failing tests to work with the corrected templates
   - Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
   - Refine error handling for interface detection

2. Begin planning for Stage 3: Component and Extension Logic Migration

   - Identify which components and extension logic need to be moved
   - Plan the migration strategy to minimize disruption

## Additional Notes

The split Explainer documentation will serve as a valuable reference for understanding the WAT syntax and component model concepts, which will be essential for fixing the test templates and implementing proper interface detection.

For the next session, please provide:

- Any insights on the specific WAT syntax issues in the templates
- Feedback on the approach for Stage 3 migration planning
