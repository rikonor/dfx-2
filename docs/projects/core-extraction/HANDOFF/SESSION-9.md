# Core Extraction Project - Session 9 Handoff

## Completed in this Session

- Added detailed documentation to all WAT templates in templates.rs:

  - Added purpose descriptions for each template
  - Documented structure and key components
  - Listed key WebAssembly Component Model features demonstrated
  - Highlighted common issues and pitfalls
  - Added test expectations for each template

- Fixed and improved template issues:
  - Fixed log function return type in nested instances template
  - Fixed duplicate interface names in DUPLICATE_INTERFACE_TEMPLATE
  - Enhanced error documentation in all templates
  - Made template comments more consistent and comprehensive

## Current State

We've completed most of Stage 2 (Core Interface Types Migration) and have started preparing for Stage 5 (Testing Infrastructure). The WAT templates have been thoroughly documented and their issues fixed. The next major task will be implementing a testing utility for validating WAT code.

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Template Documentation Structure**:

   - Each template now has a standardized documentation format
   - Includes sections for Purpose, Structure, Key Features, Common Issues, and Test Expectations
   - Makes it easier for developers to understand and modify templates

2. **Testing Utility Planning**:

   - Need to implement a utility for validating WAT code
   - Will build upon existing test infrastructure
   - Should integrate with the current testing framework

3. **Project Stage Priorities**:
   - Moving forward with Stage 5 (Testing Infrastructure) in parallel with Stage 2
   - This will help ensure better quality as we proceed with later stages

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Documentation Consistency**: Ensured all templates follow the same documentation structure for better maintainability
- **Error Documentation**: Enhanced error-related comments to help developers understand and fix issues
- **Template Organization**: Improved organization of template code with clear section markers and explanatory comments

## Next Steps

1. Set up WAT validation testing utility:

   - Implement the validation script (to be provided in next session)
   - Create test cases for various WAT scenarios
   - Add integration tests for the validation utility

2. Complete remaining Stage 2 tasks:

   - Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
   - Finalize error handling for interface detection

3. Continue Stage 5 tasks:
   - Improve test coverage for core functionality
   - Add more test utilities as needed
   - Create benchmarks for core operations

## Additional Notes

The next session will focus on implementing the WAT validation testing utility. The user has a script ready that we'll integrate into our testing infrastructure.

For the next session, please have the WAT validation script ready to share. We'll use it to enhance our testing capabilities and ensure our WAT templates are valid according to the WebAssembly Component Model specifications.
