## Current Focus

Stage 2: Core Interface Types Migration

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create dfx-core crate
2. ✅ Update workspace Cargo.toml
3. ✅ Set up initial module structure
4. ✅ Create minimal public API
5. ✅ Add unit tests for core functionality
6. Stage 2: Core Interface Types Migration:
   - ✅ Move Interface/ComponentInterfaces to dfx-core
   - ✅ Move IfaceDetector trait and implementation
   - ✅ Update dfx-cli to use these from dfx-core
   - ✅ Update integration tests for interface detection
   - ✅ Implement actual interface detection in dfx-core
   - Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
   - Refine error handling for interface detection

## Notes and Observations

- Project builds upon completed Extension Inter-Communication project
- Core functionality from dfx-cli needs to be carefully extracted
- Testing infrastructure will be priority to ensure stability
- The interface detection implementation has been restored to use the proper wasmtime API for component inspection
- Some test-utils tests are failing and will need to be fixed in the next session

## Recent Activity

- Restored the proper interface detection implementation in dfx-core
- Updated test-utils to depend on dfx-core directly
- Verified that dfx-core tests pass with the restored implementation
- Identified issues with test-utils tests that need to be addressed

## Blockers/Issues

- Some test-utils tests are failing and need to be fixed
- Need to review and update the test templates to work with the current implementation

## Upcoming Tasks

Continue Stage 2 implementation:

- Fix failing test-utils tests
- Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
- Refine error handling for interface detection
- Begin planning for Stage 3: Component and Extension Logic Migration
