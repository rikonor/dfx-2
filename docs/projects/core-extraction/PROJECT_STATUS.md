## Current Focus

Stage 2: Core Interface Types Migration (Final Steps)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create dfx-core crate
2. ✅ Update workspace Cargo.toml
3. ✅ Set up initial module structure
4. ✅ Create minimal public API
5. ✅ Add unit tests for core functionality
6. Stage 2: Core Interface Types Migration:
   - ✅ Move Interface/ComponentInterfaces to dfx-core
   - ✅ Move IfaceDetector trait and implementation
   - ✅ Update dfx-cli to use these from dfx-core
   - ✅ Update integration tests for interface detection
   - ✅ Implement actual interface detection in dfx-core
   - ✅ Split the Explainer.md into smaller more focused files for easier reference
   - ✅ Fix WAT templates in test-utils with proper component model syntax
   - Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
   - Refine error handling for interface detection

## Notes and Observations

- Project builds upon completed Extension Inter-Communication project
- Core functionality from dfx-cli needs to be carefully extracted
- Testing infrastructure will be priority to ensure stability
- The interface detection implementation has been restored to use the proper wasmtime API for component inspection
- Enhanced error handling with specific error types for interface detection
- Added comprehensive documentation to the interface module
- Added more test templates for edge cases, but still encountering issues with the WebAssembly Component Model's canonical ABI requirements

## Recent Activity

- Enhanced error handling in the interface detection module
- Added comprehensive documentation to the interface module
- Created new test templates for edge cases (empty component, many interfaces, nested instances, duplicate interfaces)
- Fixed WebAssembly Component Model template issues:
  - Fixed parameter type mismatch in string handling functions
  - Fixed return type mismatch in string return functions
  - Fixed boolean conversion for boolean return values
  - Fixed duplicate interface naming issues
  - Fixed log function return type in nested instances template
- Added detailed comments to all WAT templates explaining:
  - Purpose of each template
  - Structure and key components
  - Key WebAssembly Component Model features demonstrated
  - Common issues and pitfalls
  - Test expectations

## Blockers/Issues

- WebAssembly Component Model template issues:
  - Some functions still have mismatches between their signatures and the canonical ABI requirements
  - Need to identify and fix the specific functions causing the errors

## Upcoming Tasks

Complete Stage 2 implementation:

- Fix the remaining issues with the WebAssembly Component Model templates
- Complete the comprehensive tests for interface detection
- Finalize error handling for interface detection

Begin planning for Stage 3:

- Identify which components and extension logic need to be moved
- Plan the migration strategy to minimize disruption
- Create a detailed task list for Stage 3 implementation
