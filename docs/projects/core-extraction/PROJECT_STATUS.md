## Current Focus

Stage 2: Core Interface Types Migration (Final Steps)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create dfx-core crate
2. ✅ Update workspace Cargo.toml
3. ✅ Set up initial module structure
4. ✅ Create minimal public API
5. ✅ Add unit tests for core functionality
6. Stage 2: Core Interface Types Migration:
   - ✅ Move Interface/ComponentInterfaces to dfx-core
   - ✅ Move IfaceDetector trait and implementation
   - ✅ Update dfx-cli to use these from dfx-core
   - ✅ Update integration tests for interface detection
   - ✅ Implement actual interface detection in dfx-core
   - ✅ Split the Explainer.md into smaller more focused files for easier reference
   - ✅ Fix WAT templates in test-utils with proper component model syntax
   - Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
   - Refine error handling for interface detection

## Notes and Observations

- Project builds upon completed Extension Inter-Communication project
- Core functionality from dfx-cli needs to be carefully extracted
- Testing infrastructure will be priority to ensure stability
- The interface detection implementation has been restored to use the proper wasmtime API for component inspection
- All test-utils tests are now passing with the fixed WAT templates

## Recent Activity

- Fixed WAT templates in test-utils to use proper component model syntax
- Added realloc function and memory handling to templates
- Updated function names to use kebab-case naming convention
- Fixed test assertions to match template changes
- All test-utils tests are now passing

## Blockers/Issues

- No current blockers

## Upcoming Tasks

Continue Stage 2 implementation:

- Add more comprehensive tests for interface detection
- Refine error handling for interface detection

Begin planning for Stage 3:

- Identify which components and extension logic need to be moved
- Plan the migration strategy to minimize disruption
