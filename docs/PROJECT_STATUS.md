**Overall Project Completion:** 63%

## Recently Completed Tasks

- Successfully implemented async function calls between extensions
- Added Send trait bound to generic type T in link_imports for thread safety
- Demonstrated working cross-extension function calls (ext-add calling ext-js)
- Implemented function reference registry for tracking references between extensions
- Added support for registering function references and creating proxy functions
- Updated main.rs to use the dynamic linker for linking imports
- Set up the infrastructure for cross-extension function calls

## Current Focus

Completing Phase 4: Dynamic Linking Implementation

- Adding comprehensive error handling for cross-extension calls
- Implementing additional test cases
- Documenting async usage patterns

## Next Steps

1. Convert project to Rust workspace structure:
   - Restructure project to support multiple extensions
   - Set up workspace for test and example extensions
   - Add starter Rust extension as basic example
2. Explore WAT-based component mocking for testing:
   - Investigate using WAT for creating mock components
   - Document the approach for future test implementations
3. Continue Phase 4 tasks alongside restructuring:
   - Document async usage patterns
   - Add comprehensive error handling

## Notes and Observations

- The successful async implementation and cross-extension function calls demonstrate the viability of our approach
- The existing architecture has proven flexible enough to accommodate async functionality
- Library interfaces (\*\*/lib) are working as intended for cross-extension communication
- Current implementation provides good foundation for future enhancements
- Potential areas for optimization in async operations identified
