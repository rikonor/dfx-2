# Session 5 Handoff Document

## Completed in this Session

- Created `src/function_registry.rs` module with core data structures for tracking function references:
  - `FunctionRegistry` struct to manage function references between extensions
  - Methods for registering, getting, and resolving function references
  - Utility methods for creating reference keys and tracking resolution status
- Created `src/dynamic_linker.rs` module for dynamic linking between extensions:
  - `DynamicLinker` struct to handle linking imports and managing function references
  - `link_imports` method to set up proxy functions for imports
  - Error handling for unresolved references
- Updated `src/main.rs` to use the dynamic linker:
  - Added the new modules to the imports
  - Created a DynamicLinker instance
  - Linked imports for each extension before instantiation
  - Set up the infrastructure for cross-extension function calls

## Current State

We've completed the initial implementation of dynamic linking, which is a key part of Phase 4. The system can now:

1. Register function references for imports
2. Create proxy functions that forward calls to the actual functions
3. Link imports to exports through the function reference registry
4. Handle errors for unresolved references

The implementation provides a solid foundation for cross-extension function calls, although we haven't fully implemented the export resolution part yet due to limitations in accessing the underlying wasmtime instance from the Extension type.

## Technical Decisions Made

- **Decision to use Arc<Mutex<Option<Func>>> for function references**: This approach allows for thread-safe, mutable references to functions that can be resolved after component instantiation.
- **Decision to use a key format for function references**: We use a key format of `extension:interface:function` to uniquely identify function references, which makes it easy to look up references when resolving exports.
- **Decision to skip export resolution for now**: Due to limitations in accessing the underlying wasmtime instance from the Extension type, we've decided to skip the export resolution part for now and focus on the import linking part.
- **Decision to use proxy functions for imports**: We use proxy functions that forward calls to the actual functions, which allows for dynamic linking without modifying the component model.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge: Borrow checker issues with closures**
  Solution: Modified the closure to avoid borrow checker issues by cloning the function name outside the closure and using a separate variable for the function reference guard.

- **Challenge: Accessing the underlying wasmtime instance**
  Solution: We couldn't directly access the underlying wasmtime instance from the Extension type generated by the bindgen! macro. We've decided to skip the export resolution part for now and focus on the import linking part.

- **Challenge: Thread-safe function references**
  Solution: Used Arc<Mutex<Option<Func>>> for function references to ensure thread safety and allow for resolution after component instantiation.

## Next Steps

### Session 6: Complete Dynamic Linking Implementation

- Implement export resolution by finding a way to access the underlying wasmtime instance from the Extension type
- Add support for calling functions across extension boundaries
- Add comprehensive error handling for missing or unresolved functions
- Add tests for the dynamic linking implementation

### Future Sessions

- Session 7: Update extension management to handle library interfaces
- Session 8: Implement comprehensive testing and refinement

## Additional Notes

The dynamic linking implementation is based on the proof-of-concept in the `tmp/` directory, which demonstrates how to link components dynamically using function references. We've adapted this approach to work with our extension system.

The current implementation focuses on the import linking part, which is the most critical part of the dynamic linking system. The export resolution part will be implemented in the next session once we find a way to access the underlying wasmtime instance from the Extension type.

## Next Session Instructions

To begin the next session effectively, please provide:

1. The current state of the project repository (it should include all the changes committed in this session)
2. Any insights or suggestions for accessing the underlying wasmtime instance from the Extension type generated by the bindgen! macro
