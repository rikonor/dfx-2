# Archive Directory

This directory previously contained handoff documents from various development sessions. These documents have been moved to their respective project directories:

- Sessions 0-7 (Extension IPC Project): Moved to `docs/projects/extension-ipc/HANDOFF/`
- Session 8+ (Core Extraction Project): Located in `docs/projects/core-extraction/HANDOFF/`

This reorganization aligns with our project-based documentation structure as outlined in `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.

## Historical Context

The early handoff documents (Sessions 0-7) document the development of the Extension IPC Project, which was the first project in this repository. They contain valuable historical information about the initial development process and decisions made during the implementation of the extension inter-communication feature.
