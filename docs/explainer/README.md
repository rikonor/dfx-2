# WebAssembly Component Model Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the WebAssembly Component Model, split into smaller, more manageable files for easier reference.

## Files

- **explainer-overview.md**: Introduction, gated features, and high-level concepts
- **explainer-grammar.md**: Core grammar definitions
- **explainer-component-definitions.md**: Component and instance definitions
- **explainer-type-system.md**: Type definitions, type checking, and the type system
- **explainer-canonical-abi.md**: Canonical definitions and ABI
- **explainer-values-and-imports.md**: Value definitions, start definitions, imports/exports
- **explainer-js-embedding.md**: JavaScript embedding and ESM integration
- **explainer-examples.md**: Examples and use cases

## Purpose

These files are derived from the original WebAssembly Component Model Explainer document. The content has been split to make it easier to reference specific parts of the documentation when needed, without loading the entire document.

This documentation serves as a reference for understanding the WebAssembly Component Model, particularly the WAT syntax and component model concepts, which are essential for our interface detection implementation and testing.
