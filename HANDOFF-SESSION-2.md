# Session 2 Handoff Document

## Completed in this Session

- Created `src/library.rs` module with core data structures:
  - `LibraryFunction` struct to represent functions within a library interface
  - `LibraryInterface` struct to represent library interfaces exposed by extensions
  - `DetectLibraryInterfaces` trait for detecting library interfaces in WebAssembly components
  - `LibraryInterfaceDetector` implementation that can detect library interfaces based on extension names
- Added unit tests for the library interface detection functionality
- Updated `src/main.rs` to include the new library module

## Current State

We've implemented the foundation for library interface detection, which is a key part of Phase 1 (Foundation Setup and WIT Interface Updates). The current implementation is a placeholder that uses the extension name to detect known library interfaces, but it provides the structure for a more sophisticated implementation in the future.

The tests are passing, and the code is ready for integration with the rest of the system.

## Technical Decisions Made

- Decision to simplify the `LibraryFunction` struct: We decided to only track the function name without parameter types or return types, since the host will just be proxying parameters and return values between extensions without needing to understand or manipulate them.
- Decision to use a placeholder implementation for library interface detection: Since we don't yet have access to the necessary wasmtime APIs for introspecting component exports, we're using a simplified approach based on the extension name. This will be updated in the future with actual component analysis logic.
- Decision to use WebAssembly Text (WAT) for creating test components: We're using WAT to create minimal components for testing, which is more readable and maintainable than hardcoding binary WASM.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge: Creating mock components for testing
  Solution: Used WebAssembly Text (WAT) to create minimal components for testing, which is more readable and maintainable than hardcoding binary WASM.

- Challenge: Accessing component exports for library interface detection
  Solution: Used a placeholder implementation based on extension names for now, with plans to update it with actual component analysis logic in the future.

## Next Steps

### Session 3: Update Manifest Model to Track Library Interfaces

- Update the `Extension` struct in `src/manifest.rs` to track library interfaces
- Add fields for exported and imported library interfaces
- Update serialization/deserialization to include the new fields
- Add tests for the updated manifest model

Tracking imports/exports in the manifest file will enable:

- Dependency resolution for correct extension loading order
- Validation at installation time to prevent runtime errors
- Performance optimization by avoiding repeated component analysis
- Better extension management with dependency checking
- Improved discoverability of available library interfaces

### Future Sessions

- Session 4: Implement dependency resolution
- Session 5: Create function reference registry
- Session 6: Update extension management to handle library interfaces

## Additional Notes

The current implementation is a foundation that will be built upon in future sessions. The next major step is to update the manifest model to track library interfaces, which will allow us to track dependencies between extensions.

We've learned that WebAssembly Text (WAT) is a useful tool for creating test components, and we should continue to use it in future sessions.

## Next Session Instructions

To begin the next session effectively, please provide:

1. The current state of the project repository (it should include all the changes committed in this session)
2. Any specific requirements or constraints for the manifest model update that weren't covered in our planning discussions
