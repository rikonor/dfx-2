# Session 0 Handoff Document

## Completed in this Session

- Created PLAN.md: Detailed implementation plan for the extension inter-communication feature
- Created PROJECT_STATUS.md: Initial status tracking document for the project
- Created GUIDELINES.md: Working process guidelines for maintaining continuity across sessions

## Current State

We've completed the initial planning phase for implementing the extension inter-communication feature. The project is structured into 6 phases, with an estimated completion timeline of 6 sessions. No code changes have been made yet, as this was a planning session.

## Technical Decisions Made

- Decision to limit inter-extension communication to only "\*/lib" interfaces: This ensures that extensions can only expose specific interfaces for use by other extensions, maintaining separation between CLI functionality and library functionality.
- Decision to build on the proof-of-concept in tmp/: The proof-of-concept provides a solid foundation with its automatic linking capabilities.
- Decision to implement a dependency-based loading system: Extensions will be loaded in order based on their dependencies, ensuring that dependencies are available when needed.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge: Ensuring backward compatibility with existing extensions
  Solution: Design the system to gracefully handle extensions with or without library interfaces

- Challenge: Preventing circular dependencies
  Solution: Implement cycle detection in the dependency resolution algorithm

## Next Steps

- Update the `world.wit` file to include support for library interfaces
- Create the initial `auto_linker.rs` module based on the proof-of-concept
- Implement interface filtering to ensure only "\*/lib" interfaces can be exposed

## Additional Notes

The existing project has a well-structured extension system that we can build upon. The proof-of-concept in the tmp/ directory provides an excellent starting point for the implementation, particularly the automatic linking and dependency resolution aspects.

Key files to focus on in the first session:

- wit/world.wit: Needs updating to support library interfaces
- src/main.rs: Contains the main application logic that loads and runs extensions
- src/extension.rs: Handles extension management
- src/manifest.rs: Defines the manifest structure and operations

The first session should focus on making the minimal changes necessary to add library interface support while maintaining compatibility with existing extensions.
